User Terms for Application Services
Last Updated November 14, 2022
This software application (the “Application”) is provided by General Motors Holdings LLC and its
affiliates (“GM” or “we” or “us”) and, subject to these User Terms, makes services made available to you
(the “Application Services”), via the authorized Apple or Android device that you own or control (your
“Device”), which may include the ability to view diagnostic and location information of your OnStar
equipped eligible vehicle (your “Vehicle”), to receive promotions and offers from participating retailers,
and to issue commands to your Vehicle, such as door lock/unlock and remote engine start commands.
The Application Services may be available while your Vehicle is connected to our systems via a service
trial period that we may offer from time to time, a service plan made available to you at no additional

not be available for your Vehicle unless you are participating in a paid service plan for that Vehicle.
Further details and limitations of the Application Services are available at www.onstar.com/mobileapp.
When you click to accept the following terms (these “Terms”) or when you access or use the Application
Services on your Device, you agree to the following:
• These Terms incorporate the User Terms for Connected Vehicle Services located at
onstar.com/terms (the “Connected Vehicle Service Terms”). Together, these Terms and the

foregoing, you grant, and grant on behalf of any third party authorized by you to use Tools on

respect to the collection or analysis of data from the Application or the Application Services
irrespective of any terms and conditions generally applicable to use of the Tools;
• In the event of any conflict between these Terms and the Connected Vehicle Service Terms,
these Terms will govern for any access or use of the Application Services. The reference to

User Terms for OnStar Guardian
Last Updated March 26. 2024

The Application Services may include detection of a crash event in a vehicle in which you are traveling. The Application Services may also include the ability to initiate a call to OnStar Advisors, request and receive roadside assistance services, and view location and other information of the Devices owned by or authorized to be used by the members of your “My Family” group. The Application is available to OnStar Members with select OnStar service plans, but an OnStar service plan is not required to create an Application account or to use the Application Service.

These terms (“Terms”) govern your use of and access to the Application Services on your Device and are in addition to any terms you may have accepted for OnStar and connected services. Please review these Terms carefully.

IMPORTANT: THESE TERMS CONTAIN A MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISION THAT, AS FURTHER SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH I, BELOW, REQUIRES THE USE OF ARBITRATION ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS TO RESOLVE DISPUTES. THIS MEANS THAT YOU ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT OR IN CLASS ACTIONS OF ANY KIND.

The vehicle must be moving at a sufficient speed (approximately 5 miles per hour) for a certain amount of time (approximately 10 seconds) before it can begin to detect a crash event. If a crash is detected, the Application can connect a call from an OnStar Advisor automatically on Android smartphones only; all other Devices require you to answer the call.
The Application may not connect to an OnStar Advisor in all instances. Dial “911” in case of an emergency.
A cellular signal, GPS signal, and sufficient battery life on your Device are required for the Application Services to operate properly.

The Application Services use and rely upon your Device’s sensors and functionality, including GPS signal and cellular signal, and are subject to any inaccuracy and other limitations thereof
Updates made to your Device may impact the ability of the Application to provide the Application Services.
Once you log into the Application, it will continue to run in your Device’s foreground or background until you log out, even if you close the Application.
Failure to download available updates to the Application may limit access to the Application Services.
Application Services may be limited if the Application is archived in your Device’s operating system.
IF YOU PROVIDE AN EMERGENCY CONTACT, YOU CONSENT TO US CONTACTING THAT PERSON ON YOUR BEHALF AND PROVIDING THAT PERSON WITH INFORMATION ABOUT YOU IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPLICATION SERVICES, INCLUDING YOUR DEVICE’S LOCATION.

Together, these Charging Feature Terms and the User Terms are binding between you and us and govern your access and use of the Charging Feature.

Capitalized terms used but not defined in these Public Charging Terms have the meanings set forth in the User Terms.

        Tesla’s station and charger policies also apply when you use the Charging Feature, when you visit a Tesla station, or when you use a Tesla Supercharger (the “Tesla Policies”). The Tesla Policies may be found at https://www.tesla.com/legal/terms.

        We may modify any part of the Public Charging Terms at any time by giving you notice or by posting an updated version of these Public Charging Terms through the Application.

        Connected vehicle services are required to use the Charging Feature in the Application.                    

Your OnStar Subscription and GM PublicCharging Payment Methods
To use the Charging Feature, you must maintain at least one valid payment method on file in the Application and designate that payment method as your payment method of choice for use with the Charging Feature. 
The payment method you select to use with the Charging Feature must be the same as the payment method you use to pay for any OnStar subscription or recurring paid plan. If you select a new payment method for the Charging Feature when you sign up to use the Charging Feature, GM will also use that payment method for any recurring OnStar subscription payments you may have. 
If you change your OnStar subscription payment method in the future, the new OnStar subscription payment method will be added to your saved payment methods in the Application and will be used as your designated payment method with the Charging Feature.
Charging Feature Fees and Charges
By charging your Vehicle at a participating public charging location, you agree to pay all applicable fees associated with that charging station session, including but not limited to the following fees: energy fees, idle fees, and congestion fees. You may incur idle fees or congestion fees for the time your Vehicle remains parked in a charging stall or connected to a charging station after it is finished charging.
You authorize us or our payment processor to charge the applicable fees (plus any applicable sales tax) to your designated payment method.  We will place a temporary payment authorization hold on your payment method at the start of each charge session, and will release the authorization when your charge session is complete and successfully paid.
You will receive an email receipt after you complete charging. 
Additional Terms for the Charging Feature
You will only use the Charging Feature for legitimate business or personal purposes, and not for resale.
We may suspend or terminate your use of the Charging Feature at any time, with or without notice, if you do not comply with these Public Charging Terms.

Damage to vehicle components resulting from the installation or use of non-GM approved parts is not covered under the terms of the vehicle warranty and may affect remaining warranty coverage for affected parts.

The purchase or lease price of your Vehicle may have included a trial period for some of the Services, or we may otherwise offer You a trial period for some of the Services. If so, those Services will stop automatically without further notice at the end of the trial period, unless You elect to continue the Services and agree to pay the associated fees. If You elect to continue the Services and agree to pay the associated fees, we will automatically charge those fees to the payment method associated with your account according to the terms of your authorization.

If those additional terms and conditions conflict with these User Terms, then the additional terms and conditions for fleet services will govern.

Those Services are also subject to this Agreement. Your Fleet Company may also limit the types of Services that are available to You.

15. Service Limitations.

 

15.1 The Services are only available in the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, and Canada. The Services rely on wireless communication networks and the Global Positioning System (“GPS”) satellite network. NOT ALL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE EVERYWHERE, PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE OR ENCLOSED AREAS, OR ON ALL VEHICLES, AT ALL TIMES. The area You are driving in may affect the Services that we can provide to You, including routing services.

 

15.2 The Services are only available in places where we have retained a Wireless Service Provider for Service in that area and only if the Wireless Service Provider has technical compatibility with the Connected Device, coverage, network capacity, and reception when and where the Service is needed. Services that use location information about your Vehicle only work if GPS satellite signals are unobstructed, available in that place and compatible with your Vehicle systems. Any stolen vehicle assistance services that may be included with the Services are solely intended to provide assistance in notifying You or authorities of potential theft and to potentially aid in vehicle recovery. These Services do not prevent vehicle or vehicle content theft or protect against damage or loss. We are not responsible for any losses or other harm You may incur in connection with vehicle theft.

 

15.3 YOUR VEHICLE MUST HAVE A WORKING ELECTRICAL SYSTEM (INCLUDING ADEQUATE BATTERY POWER) FOR THE SERVICES TO OPERATE.

 

15.4 The Services may not work if:

equipment on your Vehicle is not properly installed;
You have not maintained the equipment or your Vehicle in good working order;
You do not comply with all applicable laws;
You try to add, connect or modify any equipment or software in your Vehicle (such as plugging devices into the Vehicle electrical system or diagnostic port);
your Vehicle is not compatible with the Services or the wireless service and technology provided by our Wireless Service Providers (this wireless service and technology is subject to change); or
other problems arise that we cannot control that interfere with the delivery or quality of the Services, such as hills, tall buildings, tunnels, weather, electrical system design and architecture of your Vehicle, damage to important parts of your Vehicle in an accident, or wireless phone network congestion or jamming.
 

15.5  We and the Wireless Service Providers are not responsible for any delay or failure in performance that (a) may have been prevented by You taking reasonable precautions or (b) is caused by acts of nature, or forces or causes beyond our reasonable control (for example: public utility electrical failure, acts of war, government actions, terrorism, civil disturbances, labor shortages or difficulties - regardless of cause-or equipment failures including Internet, computer, telecommunication or other equipment failures).

 

15.6 The routing data we provide is based on the most current map information available to us, but the information may be inaccurate or incomplete. For example, the route data may not include information about one-way roads, turn restrictions, construction projects, seasonal roads or new roads. The suggested route may use a road that is closed for construction or a turn that is prohibited by signs at the intersection. Suggested routes also do not consider whether the areas traveled are residential, commercial, or mixed and do not factor in the availability of public or private goods and services. Therefore, You should use good judgment, obey traffic and roadway laws and instructions and evaluate whether following the routing data provided through the Services is safe and legal based on the current conditions.

 

15.7 We recommend that You carefully read the applicable terms and policies that make up this Agreement, including our Privacy Statement, before using the Services.

Appendix to User Terms
Standard End User License
Last Updated: May 1, 2018

 

This Standard End User License (“License”) applies to each App that You access or use in your Vehicle or Connected Device. Capitalized terms, if not defined in this License, are defined in the User Terms. If an App is provided by GM, then references to “Provider” in this license means GM.  If the App is provided by a third party as identified to You when You access the App, then references to “Provider” in this License means the third party identified to You at the time of download.  The Provider may present additional terms to You when You access or use an App. In that case, those additional terms apply in addition to the terms of this License, and this License will govern to the extent there are any conflicts. If You do not agree to this License, You must uninstall and not use the Apps.

 

THIS LICENSE INCLUDES AN AGREEMENT TO MANDATORY ARBITRATION, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO SUBMIT ANY DISPUTE RELATED TO THIS LICENSE TO BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION RATHER THAN PROCEEDING IN COURT.

 

THE DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROVISION ALSO INCLUDES A CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH MEANS THAT YOU AGREE TO PROCEED WITH ANY DISPUTE INDIVIDUALLY AND NOT AS PART OF A CLASS ACTION.

 

THIS LICENSE ALSO INCLUDES A JURY WAIVER.

 

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER CAN BE FOUND IN SECTION 19 (DISPUTES; BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION AND JURY TRIAL WAIVER) BELOW.

 

1.     License.  Provider is the owner or licensor of all right, title and interest in and to the App including, without limitation, any content, graphics, audiovisual files, processes, and code, along with all intellectual property rights in the App.  Subject to your compliance with this License, Provider grants You a limited, personal, noncommercial (unless a permitted use in connection with Fleet Vehicles), non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-exclusive license to install and use the App solely in object code form for its intended purpose as describe in this License and within the App on your Connected Device during the Term (as defined in Section 6 below) of the License.

You agree that Provider or GM may at any time automatically update, upgrade, modify, delete, or stop supporting the App, or cause the App to be removed automatically from your Connected Device during synchronization with your account.  If the App is updated, upgraded or modified, whether to enhance or correct features or functionality, then this License shall apply to the updates, upgrades and modifications in addition to any other terms that are presented to You in connection with the update, upgrade or modification.

To the extent GM is the Provider, GM may collect and store information about You and your Vehicle through your use of the Connected Device and the App.  Any information collected by GM is subject to and governed by the Privacy Statement included and posted with the App.

 

When You use an App provided by a Provider other than GM, the Provider may also collect, use, and share information (including sharing with us) about You as described in that Provider’s privacy policy. We recommend that You carefully review that Provider’s privacy policy before accessing or using that App.

To the extent permitted by law and unless prohibited by law, You agree that You must file any arbitration request, claim, or cause of action arising out of or related to the App or this License within one (1) year after the events giving rise to the arbitration request, claim, or cause of action, or You shall be forever barred from filing such request, claim, or cause of action.

24.     Miscellaneous.  You may not assign this License without permission of Provider.  You, Provider and GM are independent contracting parties. If the App is provided to You by a third party Provider, You agree that GM and its subsidiaries are third party beneficiaries of the License and thus GM or its subsidiaries can enforce this License against You even if it is not the Provider of the App provided that if the doctrine of third-party beneficiaries is found to not apply for any reason, the parties acknowledge and agree that while GM is not a party to this License and has no obligations under this License, the Provider is a trustee of GM for the limited purpose of holding in trust for GM the covenants in favor of GM. Accordingly, the parties agree that GM may enforce such rights and agreements in its own right (without being required to add the Provider as a party to any proceedings for such enforcement). If any term of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, then it shall be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of the agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

This License is the entire agreement between the parties with respect to its subject matter, and there are no other representations, understandings or agreements between the parties relative to such subject matter.  You cannot change this License unless Provider agrees in writing to the change. Provider may modify this License by providing notice to You, and if You do not agree with any modification, then You must stop using the App. Your continued use of the App will be deemed acceptance of such modifications.

MY GM REWARDS PROGRAM TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Updated effective as of: August 27, 2024 


Welcome to My GM Rewards Loyalty Program (the “Program”, also marketed under the names My Chevrolet Rewards, My Buick Rewards, My GMC Rewards, and My Cadillac Rewards). The brand associated with the Program (i.e. Chevrolet, Buick, GMC or Cadillac) is based on the Member’s (as defined herein) most recent GM (as defined herein) vehicle purchase. This branding can be changed at any time by accessing your Member profile information.

 

Eligible participants who enroll in the Program (“Member(s)” or “you”) can earn Program points (“Points”) by engaging in certain “Eligible Transactions” including, but not limited to, purchasing or leasing eligible GM vehicles at participating GM dealerships in the United States (“Participating Dealer(s)”), purchasing certain goods or services from a Participating Dealer or online through participating GM websites, purchasing certain services from OnStar, transacting with the My GM Rewards Mastercard ® (“Card”), or at select Third-Party Retailers (e.g., GM Financial, General Motors Insurance, energy providers, fuel providers). Points can be redeemed at Participating Dealers or at other third-party, non-dealer retailers including GM Financial and General Motors Insurance. For a complete description of the most current Eligible Transactions, as well as details on earning and redeeming Points go to experience.gm.com/rewards. Members who apply and are approved for the My GM Rewards Mastercard® Program (“Card Program”), issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA are referred to as “Cardmembers”. See complete Card Program overview at www.mygmrewardscard.com. The Program is operated by General Motors LLC (“GM”).

 

By participating in and engaging with the Program, you agree to these My GM Rewards Program Terms and Conditions, which may be updated from time to time (“Terms”), which govern the Program and your participation in the Program.  These Terms are intended to protect GM and participants in the Program by defining the rights and obligations of both under the Program. GM reserves the right to change these Terms from time to time without notice. Each time you participate or engage in any Program activities, including but not limited to, enrolling as a Member, accessing your Member Account or redeeming Points under the Program, you are agreeing to be bound by and comply with the then-current Terms and the GM Privacy Statement found at www.gm.com/privacy. In some instances, both these Terms and/or additional terms that are part of an offer, promotion, or activity which contain additional or different terms and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”) will apply to your participation in the Program. To the extent there is a conflict between these Terms and any Additional terms, the Additional Terms will control.

 

You must make sure you read and understand these Terms prior to engaging in any Program activities or with the Program. It is your responsibility to remain knowledgeable of any changes to these Terms. If you have questions about these Terms, you may contact the My GM Rewards Member Support Center at 844-764-2665. Except as otherwise published or distributed in writing from an authorized representative of GM or by Additional Terms, these Terms cannot be modified or superseded.

1. Program Eligibility

The Program is open only to residents of the 50 United States, Washington, D.C., and U.S. military locations, who are eighteen (18) years of age and older, have reached the age of majority in their state, have properly enrolled in the Program, have agreed to these Terms and are individual natural persons (an “Individual”). Business organizations of any kind, including but not limited to corporations, associations, partnerships, limited liability companies, vehicle brokers or groups of any kind are not eligible to participate in the Program. No purchase is necessary to participate in the Program and you do not need to own a GM vehicle to participate in the Program. The Program is open to GM employees, retirees, suppliers, individual dealers, and dealer employees, each in their Individual capacity, but restrictions may apply to earning or redeeming Points, special offers and Point redemption compatibility with other discounts or incentives.

 

If more than one membership is assigned to an Individual, earned Points will be assigned to the oldest Member Account with a Credit Card (“Card”) associated to it, followed by the oldest Member Account without a Card associated to it. Duplicate Member Accounts may be cancelled by GM without notice and GM has the sole discretion to reassign Points to a Member Account of its choice. Members may request to merge Member Accounts by contacting the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665.


GM may change Program eligibility requirements at any time and reserves the right to refuse or revoke membership to any applicant for any reason or close a Member’s account, in its sole discretion, including forfeiture of Points associated with any Member Account. GM reserves the right to remove or rescind Points from a Member's Account without notice if GM determines, in its sole discretion, that Points were awarded in error or due to fraud. Participation in the Program, and any application for membership in the Program, are void if prohibited by law in the state of the Member's residence and are subject to change as may be necessary to comply with such laws or regulations.

Account Verification. To earn Points, you must be a Member prior to completing an Eligible Transaction and must complete verification of your Member Account (“Account Verification”). Members will not earn Points for transactions completed prior to Account Verification, unless otherwise determined by GM at its sole discretion. Cardmembers do not need to complete Account Verification prior to earning certain Points but certain Points cannot be redeemed without completing Account Verification. You must provide and maintain a valid e-mail address to participate in the Program. Any non-Cardmember Member Account without a valid and verified email address will be deactivated and any accumulated Points will be forfeited (see section D). Any persons not meeting program eligibility as described in section 1 of these Terms will have their Member Account deactivated and any accumulated Points will be forfeited. As a Member of the Program, you will receive regular account servicing and marketing updates by email and you acknowledge that GM may communicate with you about Program changes, marketing, and promotional opportunities, General Motors Insurance transactions, and other Program information by email. You have the right to opt-out of receiving marketing content. Opting out of marketing content will not close your Member Account or opt you out from receiving communications related to the servicing or administration of your Member Account including Points that may be assigned to the Member Account. It will also not opt Cardmembers out of receiving marketing communications from Goldman Sachs Bank USA, GM affiliated entities or other third parties. GM reserves the right to contact Members who have opted out of Program marketing content to confirm they still wish to maintain an active Member Account.

Tiers. Active members are assigned into a Rewards Membership tier (“Tier”) based on “Tier Qualifying Transactions”, Cardmember status, and “Card” spend between January 1 and December 31st of the immediately preceding year. Tier Qualifying Transactions are based on Eligible Transactions excluding Certified Pre-Owned (“CPO”) vehicle purchases, GM Financial earn opportunities, General Motors Insurance transactions, and Protection Plan purchases; additional exclusions may apply. As of January 10, 2022, initial Tier assignment will be based on Cardmember status, historical GM new and CPO vehicle purchase data. Tier assignment may take up to fourteen (14) days after Account Verification. GM may change the Tier Qualifying Transactions and benefits and limitations of the Tiers at any time, in its sole discretion. The Tiers are defined by the following events, which must occur between January 1 and December 31 of the prior year; any Member at risk of losing their Tier will be notified thirty (30) days prior to the change.

Account Deactivation. GM may deactivate any Member Account, in GM’s sole discretion, when the Member does not earn Points, redeem Points, or transfer Points (in accordance with these Terms) (each an “Eligible Activity”) during a five (5) year period from the date of their last Eligible Activity. Cardmember Accounts will remain active as long as the Card remains in good standing with Goldman Sachs Bank USA, see the Card Program Rules for details on Cardmember Account deactivation. Card Accounts closed either voluntarily or due to a Cardmember not being in good standing will have access to Points earning and will operate under the conditions of the Rewards Member Program rules and associated tier level. Members may opt out of participation in the Program by contacting the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665. You will need to speak to a customer service agent directly to request that your Membership Account be deactivated or closed. You must provide your Member Number (provided during Enrollment Verification) to deactivate or close your Membership Account. You will receive a confirmation email upon deactivation. Your ability to earn Points will be suspended on the date of deactivation. Once a Member Account is deactivated you will no longer have access to your Membership Account statement information, no Points will accumulate on future Eligible Transactions, and any accumulated Points will be void and considered forfeited. If a Cardmember wishes to deactivate their Member Account, it must first close its Card.  See the My GM Rewards Card Program Rules for details.
Account Security. Each Member is responsible for creating a secure Member Account and for maintaining its security. Members should create a strong password for their Member Account and not share their password, authentication or login information with others. If the security of Member Account information is breached, GM is not liable for improper access to the Member Account, or for unauthorized changes to a Member Account. In such circumstances, GM is not responsible for reinstatement of lost Points or for any damages or losses sustained by a Member as a result of such unauthorized access. If you become aware of any fraudulent or unauthorized activity on your Member Account, you must report the fraudulent or unauthorized activity to GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665 and provide relevant information and cooperation to GM in connection with such activity. GM also reserves the right to deactivate a Member Account where GM has determined fraudulent or unauthorized activity or access has occurred.
Suspicious Activity. GM has the right to monitor all Member Account activity related to the Program. If your Member Account shows signs of fraud, abuse, or suspicious activity, GM has the right, but not the obligation, to close or freeze your Member Account immediately; you may lose your accumulated Points and may not be eligible to earn or redeem Points. If you have conducted any fraudulent activity, or any activity that, in GM’s sole discretion, undermines the integrity of the Program, GM reserves the right to take any legal action GM deems appropriate and may rescind or confiscate any Points earned or redeemed in connection with such activity. In addition, you may be liable for monetary losses to GM, including but not limited to, actual litigation costs and damages, and you will not be allowed to participate in the Program in the future. To contest the freezing of a Member Account or the voiding of Points, please call the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 844-764-2665. If your Member Account does not reflect the correct number of Points that you should have been awarded as determined by GM, GM reserves the right to adjust your Point balance. If you believe your Member Account has been the subject of any suspicious activity, please contact the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665 immediately. GM also reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to transfer the Points you have earned to a new Member Account.
Suspension. GM reserves the right, but does not have the obligation, to suspend or discontinue any Member’s participation in the Program for any Member who is, in GM’s sole discretion, using the Program in a manner that is not consistent with these Terms or the intent of the Program, or who has:
acted in a manner inconsistent with federal, state or local laws, regulations or ordinances;
breached or violated any of these Terms;
engaged in any fraudulent or dishonest behavior, theft, misconduct or wrongdoing in connection with the Program;
engaged in any abusive, fraudulent, disruptive, inappropriate, offensive or hostile conduct, whether physical or verbal, towards any employee, agent or representative of GM, or of any Participating Dealer or Third-Party Retailer; or
failed to pay bills, payments due to GM Financial, or accounts due to GM, or accounts due to Goldman Sachs Bank USA, or to any Participating Dealer or Third-Party Retailer.
 
If GM discontinues or terminates your Membership, you may immediately lose all accumulated Points. You may also lose all other Program benefits.

3. Points


General. GM may offer Points to Members for participating in Eligible Transactions. Points are not legal tender and are not your property and have no property value. Points are issued without separate payment or other consideration by you and exist at the sole discretion of GM as part of the Program. Points are non-negotiable, cannot be purchased or sold by Members, cannot be redeemed for cash or credit or any monetary value or currency, and cannot be used to pay debts except where GM Financial, General Motors Insurance or OnStar expressly accepts Points. Points may not be assigned, transferred, traded or pledged to any third party, except as expressly authorized by GM.  Points cannot be transferred by operation of law, such as by bankruptcy or in connection with a divorce. GM may consider a request to transfer Points upon a Member’s death to a surviving spouse, and may require proof, such as a death certificate, in order to process such request, which will be in GM’s sole discretion. Points that are sold, transferred, or assigned may be rescinded or confiscated in GM’s sole discretion. Points will be available only to the Individual identified by the Member Account and only if the Member completes an Eligible Transaction, after a reasonable period of time.
Earning Points. Members may earn Points by participating in Eligible Transactions, which may include purchasing eligible products or services at Participating Dealers, at Third Party Retailers, or transacting with an active Card. In order to receive Points, the Individual participating in each Eligible Transaction must match the identification information on the Member Account. A Cardmember who has not created GM credentials for a Member Account may not earn points on certain transactions. A complete list of Eligible Transactions is available at experience.gm.com/rewards. The list of Eligible Transactions and the Points that are awarded for those transactions may change from time to time in GM’s sole discretion without prior notice.  Members can earn Points based on information provided to GM by Participating Dealers, Third-Party Retailers or other participating entities. Availability of Participating Dealerships and Third-Party Retailer will vary. Participating Dealers and Third-Party Retailers can change at any time without prior notice. A list of Participating Dealers can be located via the experience.gm.com/rewards website in the “Locate a Dealer” field or by contacting the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665.  Members will not earn Points for transactions at GM dealers that are not Participating Dealers or at retailers that are not Third-Party Retailers at the time of the transaction. Eligible Transactions and other Point earning offers and opportunities may be subject to Additional Terms, including but not limited eligibility restrictions and limited availability, redemption limitations, and all such Additional Terms must be satisfied to earn Points for such transactions. When Points are earned based on dollars spent, Members do not earn Points on taxes, discounts, rebates, credits, incentives, body shop repairs, or state inspection fees to the extent the price was reduced by the use of a coupon. If you return or exchange an item on which you earned Points, we may deduct Points from your Member Account up to the number of Points you originally received for that purchase. If you return an item on which Points were redeemed, you will receive those Points back to your Membership Account, within thirty (30) days. If the return impacts the Tier you achieved at the time of the purchase (i.e. your returned item takes your Tier from Gold to Silver), GM will notify you regarding the possible demotion.
If Points were awarded to a Member’s Account due to a technical or human error, GM reserves the right, in GM’s sole discretion to remove or rescind such erroneously added Points from such impacted Account, with or without notice. If such erroneously awarded Points were redeemed, GM reserves the right to take impacted Accounts into a negative balance. In such a case, the Member would first have to earn enough Points to take the Account out of the negative balance before being able to redeem Points.
Promotional Points. From time to time, GM may offer opportunities to earn promotional Points that are subject to Additional Terms (“Promotional Points”). All applicable Additional Terms associated with the specific promotional offer must be met in order to earn Promotional Points. Promotional Points will be posted to your Member Account within thirty (30) days after the end date of the applicable promotion, unless otherwise specified in the promotion-specifically.
Point Credits. Points will be credited to your account within forty-five (45) days after completing an Eligible Transaction. The award transaction date can in some circumstances differ from the earn transaction date. Points earned for service enrollment bonus may not be redeemed on that same day for Participating Dealer services or vehicle redemptions. GM reserves the right to rescind or adjust, at any time, any pending or available Points that were awarded in connection with this Program. Points earned through fraudulent activity, sham, inaccurate reporting, mistake, or falsified information may also be rescinded by GM. Point credits and redemption activity can be accessed in your Member Account. If you believe you did not receive the correct amount of Points for an Eligible Transaction, you may contact the GM Rewards Member Support Center at 1-844-764-2665 within ninety (90) days of completing the Eligible Transaction. GM will make the final determination, in its sole discretion, as to whether Point adjustments of any kind are justified.
Point Expiration. Expiration of Points can differ based on Tier assigned and Cardmember status. Non-Cardmember Points will expire without further notice upon Member Account deactivation. Points earned prior to September 8, 2021 will expire five (5) years from the date of the last Eligible Activity associated with the Member Account. Promotional Points may expire earlier, as disclosed in the applicable Additional Terms. Visit experience.gm.com/rewards for Tier specific Point expiration details.
Point Transfers. Members can transfer Points to other Members by completing a Points transfer application. To be eligible to receive a Point transfer, the recipient Member Account must be activated, the recipient Member’s primary email address must match the email address entered into the Point transfer application by the sending Member, and the Members must reside in the same household. As a Member, in the event of a Point transfer, you agree that your personal information such as your email address may be shared with GM and its service providers for purposes of completing the Point transfer process. Points transferred in this manner will be governed by the point expiration rules of the recipient Member Account. GM may set limits to the number of times Points can be transferred or to the number of Points that can be transferred and change these limitations at any time in its sole discretion without prior notice. Transferred Points will be immediately removed from the sending Member Account and credited to the recipient Member Account. Point transfers are subject to tax reporting, final, nonrefundable and nonreversible. GM may rescind or confiscate Points and suspend the Member Accounts of any Members who are suspected of using the Points transfer tool in a manner inconsistent with these Terms or to sell, purchase, trade or barter Points.
Point Redemption. Members can redeem their Points toward purchases of goods or services at Participating Dealers, Third-Party Retailers or, for Cardmembers only, with Goldman Sachs Bank USA so long as the Member has sufficient Points in their Member Account to qualify, Visit experience.gm.com/rewards to see where Points can be redeemed, and what redemption options are currently available.  GM may change redemption options and Point value from time to time in its sole discretion without prior notice.  It is the responsibility of the Member to specifically request the redemption of Points in connection with a particular redemption.  Once redemption is requested, the corresponding Points will be deducted from the Member Account immediately.  There are different ways to redeem Points. See the various ways in which a Member can redeem points here experience.gm.com/rewards/earn-redeem.

For some redemptions, the Member must provide the last four digits of the Member Number as well as additional personal information that was provided by the Member at time of enrollment to the Participating Dealer or Third-Party Retailer.
Point Restrictions. Except as otherwise specified by GM in writing, Members using a GM Employee or GM Dealership Employee discount to purchase or lease a vehicle cannot combine Points with those discounts. GM reserves the right to make any other incentive or pricing program incompatible with Points pursuant to the Program at any time. Points may not be combined with other discounts, packages or promotional offers from GM or from Participating Dealers or Third-Party Retailers.
Points may be used only once. Points may not be sold, bartered, brokered, purchased or otherwise assigned or transferred except with the express written consent of GM. GM reserves the right to change this limit without notice. Points redeemed are not refundable but may be returned to the Member Account in accordance with section 3.b. Earning Points. Points will not be replaced, reissued or credited if lost, stolen or destroyed. Points may be subject to additional eligibility restrictions, limited availability, and/or Additional Terms.
Members cannot use Points toward certain products or services. Ineligible products include, but are not limited to: items excluded by law; prepaid cards; lottery tickets; taxes, fees; vehicle deposits; and other items GM considers to be ineligible. Points for discounts or credits on goods and services cannot be used to pay taxes. You are responsible for any personal tax liability that may be related to your use and redemption of Points. Cardmembers should refer to Card Program Rules for additional Point redemption opportunities and restrictions.  


Whether or not an item you purchase using Points can be returned at a Participating Dealer or Third-Party Retailer is subject to the discretion of GM or the Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer, respectively, and applicable law.  

Redemptions for OnStar® connected vehicle services (the “OnStar® Services”) require that a Member have an active OnStar Services account and that the OnStar® account be linked to the Member’s Account. Visit My Account on the brand web site to link your OnStar account to your GM profile.  

If the OnStar account is linked to more than one Member Account, we will award it to the earliest created account. OnStar earn will not be awarded to each Member Account where the same OnStar account may be linked.  

For issues finding a Connected Vehicle Services account contact OnStar® at 1-888-466-7827.

Redemptions of Points towards the downpayment on a General Motors Insurance policy require the Member to provide their Member Number to General Motors Insurance during the insurance quote process. Members may redeem any number of Points toward the downpayment on the General Motors Insurance policy, up to the total amount of the quote.

7. Dispute Resolution
 

GM is committed to customer satisfaction, so if you have a problem or dispute, we will try to resolve your concerns. But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.

You agree to give GM an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Program, including but not limited to any dealings you may have with our customer service agents, any services or products provided in conjunction with the Program, any representations made by us, or any aspect of our Privacy Policy (“Claims”), by contacting the GM Rewards Member Center at 1-844-764-2665. If we are not able to resolve your Claims within sixty (60) days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.


ANY AND ALL CLAIMS WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, CONFIDENTIAL ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court otherwise having jurisdiction over such Claims. This includes any Claims you assert against us, Participating Dealers or Third Party Retailers, or any other participating third parties offering products or services as part of this Program, all of which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement. This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms of Use, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms of Use required arbitration. Arbitrated claims relating to the Program will be settled under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). You can get rules and fee information from the AAA at www.adr.org. The arbitrator is not authorized to award punitive, consequential or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual damages. The arbitration proceedings and arbitration award shall be maintained by the parties as strictly confidential. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.
 

THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS LIMITED. HOWEVER, AN ARBITRATOR CAN AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING STATUTORY DAMAGES, ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND COSTS), AND MUST FOLLOW AND ENFORCE THESE TERMS OF USE AS A COURT WOULD.

ANY AND ALL PROCEEDINGS TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL. 

EACH PARTY WILL BEAR ITS OWN COSTS, FEES AND EXPENSES OF ARBITRATION.


This section will survive termination of the Program or your Member Account and any bankruptcy. If any portion of this Dispute Resolution section is deemed invalid or unenforceable, it will not invalidate the remaining portions of this Dispute Resolution section.

8. Limitations of Liability
 

GM makes no guarantees, warranties, or representations of any kind concerning the Program except as expressly contained in these Terms. You release GM and its affiliates, participating Dealers and Third Party Retailers from all liability regarding the earning, redemption, and use of Points, including any product, service or reward redeemed with Points that, after receipt, may be lost, stolen, or destroyed. 


Participating Dealers and Third Party Retailers are independent entities and are not agents or representatives of GM. Redemption at a Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer may vary. GM is not responsible for, and assumes no liability for, the actions or redemption responsibilities of a Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer. Nothing in the Program or in these Terms is intended to create any agency, partnership or joint venture between GM and any Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer. If any Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer improperly denies any Member any benefit they are entitled to under the Program, the liability of the Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer, or of GM, is limited to the fair market value of the denied benefit as determined by GM.
 

GM PROVIDES THE PROGRAM “AS IS” AND, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DESIGN, ACCURACY, CAPABILITY, SUFFICIENCY, SUITABILITY, CAPACITY, COMPLETENESS OR AVAILABILITY.
 

You agree that GM has not represented that (1) the Program will include any particular products or services, (2) that the Program will not be interrupted, without omissions or error free, or (3) that defects will be corrected or changes implemented. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO GM’S OWN NEGLIGENCE, WILL GM BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE PROGRAM, EVEN IF A REPRESENTATIVE OF GM HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In the event GM is held liable for any act, error or omission related to the Program, your sole and exclusive remedy will be limited to reimbursement for services or products you paid for but did not receive under the Program, or the issuance of Points under the Program as compensation, at GM’s election. You agree to waive any claim or action of any kind in any forum that is not commenced and served on GM within two (2) years after the first occurrence of the kind of act, event, condition or omission upon which the claim or action is based.

9. Modification of Terms


General. GM may modify, amend, cancel, delete, change or terminate the Program or any Terms of the Program in any manner at any time in GM’s sole discretion, including but not limited to terms applicable to eligibility for Membership, Point values, redemption values, redemption caps, rules for receiving or using Points, or any other aspect of the Program. These modifications may affect Points already received, including Point value, or the opportunity to use such Points or their redemption rate. We will provide notice of modification of these Terms by posting revisions to these Terms on experience.gm.com/rewards and updating the last modified date. If required by applicable law, we will additionally send notice of the modifications to you at an email address we have on file. Modifications to these Terms are effective immediately when posted. You agree that each time you access your Member Account or otherwise use or participate in the Program you are accepting and agreeing to be bound by the then-current Terms. You are responsible for remaining knowledgeable as to any changes that GM may make to these Terms and should therefore review the Terms each time you use or access the Program. If you do not agree to be bound by the Terms as modified, your only recourse is to cancel your Member Account and your failure to do so constitutes your continued acceptance of these Terms. The most current version of these Terms are available at experience.gm.com/rewards and supersede all previous versions of these Terms.
 
GM may, but is not required to, send notice to Members to advise them as to Point forfeiture or Program updates, modifications or changes. Neither GM nor any Participating Dealer or Third Party Retailer will be liable for failing to notify a Member of such changes, modifications or forfeitures, or for problems of any kind with any of the programming or equipment associated with or utilized by a Member, or for any human error or any disruption, interruption, deletion, omission, defect or line failure of any telephone network or electronic transmission, or for problems related to computer software, equipment, inability to access any website or online service, or any other technical or non-technical error or malfunction, or for lost, late, stolen, illegible, incomplete, unintelligible, misdirected or damaged mail or email. All interpretations of these Terms are at the sole discretion of GM, and its determinations as to these Terms shall be final.
 

Termination of the Program. While the Program has no predetermined end date, GM may terminate the Program at any time, with or without notice. In the event the Program is terminated, you will have ninety (90) days from the date the Program termination is announced by any reasonable and customary communication channels as GM determines in its sole discretion to use any available Points remaining in your Member Account. After that date, any Points will be forfeited without compensation.
 
Invalidity. If any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions hereof will remain in full force and effect. The failure of GM to exercise any of its rights under these Terms does not constitute a waiver of such rights in any other instance.
10. Tax Implications
 

The monetary value of a transaction for which you redeem your Points may be considered taxable income from GM in the tax year in which you redeem the Points, in accordance with U.S. tax law. GM may be required to send you (and file with the IRS) a Form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income) for the year in which you redeem your Points when the value of the transaction plus other taxable miscellaneous income you receive from GM totals $600 or more for a calendar year. We determine the taxable value of transaction received through your Points redemptions for this purpose. You're responsible for any personal tax liability due to the receipt of a transaction due to your Point redemption. Please consult with your tax advisor.
