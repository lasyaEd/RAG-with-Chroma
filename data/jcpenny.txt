JCPenney reserves the right to suspend or discontinue the emailing of JCPenney Rewards updates, Rewards certificates, and/or related materials to Members at any time and for any reason.

Online Enrollment
To enroll online, visit www.jcp.com/rewards and follow the instructions. To receive all benefits associated with the Program, including electronic notification and access to Rewards certificates, you will need to have a jcp.com account.

Auto-Enrollment of JCPenney Credit Cardmembers and JCPenney Mastercard Cardmembers
Holders of valid JCPenney Credit Card and JCPenney Mastercard accounts, who are residents of the 50 United States and Puerto Rico and who are 18 years of age or older, are automatically enrolled in the Program. Limit one Membership per credit card account.

Auto-enrolled JCPenney Credit Cardmembers and JCPenney Mastercard Cardmembers, who did not provide a valid email address in connection with their JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard, do not have the ability to view Rewards account activity online, download and print earned Rewards Certificates or other Program benefits, update their personal information online, or enjoy other benefits of online enrollment. These Members can link a valid email address to their JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard at www.jcp.com/rewards, in-store, or during the JCPenney Credit Card application process. Auto-enrolled JCPenney Credit Cardmembers and JCPenney Mastercard Cardmembers who do not link an email address to their JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard will receive their Rewards through the U.S. mail. To complete your online registration and enjoy the associated benefits, visit www.jcp.com/rewards and follow the instructions.

In-store Enrollment
When you make a purchase at a JCPenney store, you may be asked if you would like to enroll in JCPenney Rewards. To enroll, you will need to provide a phone number and valid email address. We will use the phone number and email address as a way to look up your Rewards profile at checkout in order to assign Points to your Program account. We will also send electronic statements and other materials to you at that email address. If you have already provided us with an email address or phone number for use in connection with the Program, please provide the same email address or phone number in connection with your in-store enrollment so that your Program account reflects all of the Points you earn.

Mobile Application Enrollment
If you have downloaded a JCPenney mobile application, you can enroll through the application.

Creation of jcp.com Account
On or after July 11, 2017, you will be automatically enrolled in the Program if you create a new jcp.com account.

Rewards Points & Certificates+
For each $1 spent on a qualifying purchase at JCPenney stores or jcp.com, you will receive 1 and one half JCPenney CashPass Rewards point ("Point") up to the Point Maximum if the purchase is made with a JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard in good standing. If you use a different payment method, you will receive 1 CashPass Point for each $1 spent on a qualifying purchase up to the Point Maximum. The maximum number of CashPass Points that you can receive for a single purchase transaction at JCPenney Stores or jcp.com is 2,000 CashPass Points ("Point Maximum") regardless of the amount of the qualifying purchase. JCPenney Mastercard® cardmembers also earn CashPass Points when using their JCPenney Mastercard account outside of JCPenney Stores and jcp.com, provided their JCPenney Mastercard account is open and in good standing. Earn 1 CashPass Point for every $5 dollars in net purchases (purchases made by you or an authorized user minus returns and adjustments) everywhere Mastercard is accepted (other than JCPenney Stores and jcp.com). Balance Transfers, Cash Advances, finance charges, and fees do not qualify for CashPass Points. Amounts are calculated based upon the sum of the prior billing cycle's Mastercard purchases less returns and includes points earned from applicable bonus offers. CashPass Points are issued with respect to jcp.com orders (made online or in-store) when payment card/account is charged and item(s) have shipped. CashPass Points are earned on the dollar amount of the qualifying purchase after all applicable discounts, offers, coupons and CashPasses are applied. If you return a qualifying purchase, the CashPass Points you received for that purchase will be deducted from your Program account in the month the return is made. The following are not qualifying purchases: dollars spent on sales tax, state fees, and charges and fees (e.g. shipping, delivery or installation charges, and restocking or recycling fees). No adjustments for missing CashPass Points will be made to a Member's Program account after 90 days from the actual purchase. CashPass Points will not be awarded for pre-sale, return or exchange transactions.

Members will need to take one of the following steps in order to assign CashPass Points to their Program account:

In-store
Provide the phone number or email address associated with your JCPenney Rewards profile when you make a purchase to receive CashPass Points.

During jcp.com checkout
Sign in to your jcp.com account before checking out on jcp.com. If you use Guest checkout at jcp.com and use a payment method other than the JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard linked to your account, CashPass points will not be issued until you call 1-800-322-1189. Please have your order confirmation available for reference when you call.

Once you reach 200 points, you will be issued a $10 JCPenney CashPass Reward (“CashPass”) redeemable on eligible JCPenney purchases (some exclusions and restrictions apply; see CashPass for details) and 200 CashPass points will be deducted from your Program account. The $10 CashPass may be advertised as 5% for purchases at JCPenney stores or jcp.com ($200 spent = $10 reward), and for JCPenney Mastercard cardmembers, 1% for purchases everywhere else Mastercard is accepted ($1,000 spent = $10 reward). CashPass Rewards will be applied prior to any companywide discounts or coupons (e.g., 20% off or $10 off a purchase of $25 or more). CashPass Points will not expire if your Program account stays “active.” “Active” means that you earn CashPass points for a qualifying purchase at least once in a 12-month period.

CashPasses will state the date they expire. CashPasses will be delivered via email or are accessible at www.jcp.com/rewards or at the register at check out. CashPass Rewards will be mailed to JCPenney credit cardmembers (other than residents of HI) who do not have a valid email address on file with their Program Account. Residents of HI must provide a valid email address to receive rewards and other Program benefits. You will be notified as they are earned. If you use a CashPass to make a purchase that is less than the amount designated on the CashPass, you will forfeit the remainder of that CashPass. CashPasses cannot be credited to any account, redeemed for cash, replaced if merchandise is returned, or applied to prior purchases. Lost, stolen or expired CashPasses are not replaceable. Unless otherwise expressly stated or pursuant to a particular Program feature, Program membership, points, CashPasses and offers are not transferable. CashPasses are void where prohibited by law.

Delivery of Rewards:

Online and Email
Rewards will be delivered via email or are accessible at www.jcp.com/rewards or through a JCPenney mobile application or in-store at the register at checkout. Residents of HI must provide a valid email address to receive Rewards and other Program benefits. Notification of an earned Reward will be delivered via email to the email address associated with the Program account. Rewards will be available within approximately 24 hours after a Member has earned a Reward.

Mail
For auto-enrolled JCPenney Credit Cardmembers and JCPenney Mastercard Cardmembers (other than residents of HI) who do not have a valid email address on file with the Program, notification of earned Rewards will be delivered by U.S. Mail and addressed to the primary JCPenney Credit Card or JCPenney Mastercard Member's address on record. Rewards will be mailed approximately 3-4 weeks after the Reward is earned. Auto-enrolled Members must maintain an accurate mailing address and other information with JCPenney Credit Card Services.

Additional Terms+
JCPenney Rewards Membership and its benefits are offered at the discretion of JCPenney. JCPenney reserves the right to amend or modify the Program or any of its terms, features or benefits at any time and in any way without notice (including, without limitation, the number of Points or Rewards earned for each dollar in purchases, the number of Points that can be earned per purchase transaction, the type and amount of any JCPenney Reward certificate, and the type and amount of other Program benefits). JCPenney further reserves the right to terminate the Program or any Program features or benefits at any time without notice.

We may change these Terms as described above at any time in our sole discretion by posting the updated Terms at www.jcp.com/rewards. Your continued participation in the Program will constitute your acceptance of such changes. You should therefore periodically visit this page to review the then-current Terms to which you are bound.

JCPenney is not responsible for undelivered, misdelivered, or delayed email transmissions or mail or text messages or for incorrect addresses and other contact information resulting from incorrect or incomplete personal information (including, without limitation, email address or other contact information) provided by a Member or for a Member's failure to notify JCPenney of a change in such information.

JCPenney reserves the right to interpret and apply the policies and procedures communicated in these Terms in its sole discretion, subject to applicable law. All determinations by JCPenney will be final and conclusive in each case. These Terms supersede all previously published Terms in their entirety.

In the event of a dispute over ownership of the Program account, the account will be declared to belong to the authorized account holder of the email address submitted at the time of enrollment. For purposes of these Terms, the "authorized account holder" is the natural person who is assigned to the submitted email address by an internet provider, online service provider, or other organization (e.g., business, educational institution, etc.) that is responsible for assigning email addresses for the domain associated with the submitted email address.

Abuse of the Program (e.g. failure to follow Program policies and procedures, or the sale or barter of Rewards, products, Points, promotional offers, or other improper conduct), as determined by JCPenney in its sole judgment may result in a Member being disqualified from participation in the Program, including forfeiture of previously issued but unused Rewards, and previously accrued Points, all to the extent permitted by applicable law. At our discretion we may prosecute abuse of the Program to the fullest extent of the law.

Unless otherwise expressly stated or pursuant to a particular Program feature, Program membership, Points, Rewards and offers are not transferable and may not be combined among Members. Rewards and accrued Points do not constitute property of the Member and are not transferable by the Member upon death, as part of a domestic relations matter, or otherwise.

JCPenney reserves the right to make promotional offers available to select Members based on use of a JCPenney credit card, the status of their JCPenney credit card, purchase activity, geographic location, Program participation, and/or information supplied by the Member. JCPenney reserves the right to add, withdraw, amend, or otherwise change bonus opportunities at any time at its sole discretion, with or without notice to Members.

JCPenney, its subsidiaries and affiliate entities, and their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents (the "Released Parties") make no warranty, express or implied, including, but not limited to, any warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose with respect to the Program, Membership in the Program, or any products or services related to the Program.

By participating in the Program, each Member hereby releases the Released Parties from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and other expenses (including, without limitation, attorney's fees) relating to that Member's participation in the Program, use of Rewards Certificates, or agreement to these Terms, to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The JCPenney logo, JCPenney Rewards logo, and other logos and taglines are the intellectual property of JCPenney.

These terms will be governed by and construed under the substantive laws of the State of Texas, without reference to conflict-of-laws considerations.

Arbitration
Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating in any way to a Member's participation in the Program, including, without limitation, the issuance of Points, the issuance or redemption of Rewards, or the receipt of any Program benefits, will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that a Member may assert claims in small claims court if the Member's claims qualify. In addition, JCPenney and Members each retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement to arbitrate. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. The scope of discovery is more limited in arbitration than in court. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these JCPenney Rewards Program Terms and Conditions as a court would. To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to JCPenney's Registered Agent/Legal Department, located at 6501 Legacy Drive, Plano, Texas 75024. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA's Consumer Arbitration Rules. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The AAA's rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules. JCPenney will reimburse all such filing, administration and arbitrator fees for claims totaling less than $10,000, unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. Likewise, JCPenney will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous. A Member may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the county where you live or at another mutually agreed location. JCPenney and Member each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. JCPenney and Member each hereby waive the right to participate in any class action, whether in court or arbitration. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration JCPenney and Member each waive any right to a jury trial.
