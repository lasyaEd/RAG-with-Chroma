1. Creating Your myAudi Account
In order to use the Services, you must agree to these Terms of Service.  Certain Services, namely the myAudi Marketplace, require establishing a myAudi account.  

You will be bound by these Terms of Service if:  (i) you create a myAudi account; (ii) you sign a contract that includes these Terms of Service; (iii) you authorize your independent AoA-authorized dealership (“Audi Dealer”) to create a myAudi account on your behalf; or (vi) you or someone you authorize to use your Vehicle and the Service uses the Service or accepts any of its benefits.

2. Changes to Terms of Service
We may change these Terms of Service from time to time and can change, add, or delete Services at any time.  We will notify you of such change by sending notice of or otherwise posting amended terms through the myAudi mobile app and/or myAudi web portal or as required by law.  Any change in prices for your Service Plan (as defined below) will not take effect until the current term of your Paid Plan has expired.  It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service periodically.  You can cancel this Agreement if you do not agree to the change, but if you do not notify us within 30 days after we give you notice of the change, then the change will become part of this agreement.  You agree that you are accepting such changes for yourself and any additional users of the Service using your Vehicle.

5. Paid Service Plans, Related Service Costs, Taxes and Other Charges, and Paid Plan Payment Terms
a. Paid Service Plans.
We may make available as a part of the Service certain paid services, features, or subscription-based Service Plans (collectively, “Paid Plans”) from time to time, each with various services and features for model year 2020 and later Vehicles (with any plan(s) for a Service referenced collectively herein as a “Service Plan(s)”).  Information about specific features for Service Plans, including information and pricing for Paid Plans, is available at the myAudi web portal, the myAudi Marketplace (as defined below), and/or the myAudi mobile application or by calling us at 1-877-505-2834.  Service Plans may include services provided by certain third parties that are subject to separate terms and conditions.

b. Introductory Period
The purchase or lease of your Vehicle may include an introductory period for Paid Plans (also referred to as a “trial plan”).  The introductory period, if any and unless otherwise stated, starts on the date that you activate your trial and continues for the time specified in the trial plan.  You can learn about the features included in your Service Plans, including Paid Plans, additional features that may be available to you, and the prices for Paid Plans and additional features (the “Service Rates”), on the myAudi web portal, the myAudi Marketplace, and the myAudi mobile application (“my Audi App”) or by calling us at 1-877-505-2834.  You may terminate Service during the introductory period of the Paid Plan, if any, included with the purchase or lease of your Vehicle by contacting an Audi connect customer service representative at 1-877-505-2834.  However, (certain) Connect CARE features may remain active and enabled. For more information, please contact us or your local dealership or consult your Vehicle’s documentation.

c. Renewal After Introductory Period
After any included introductory period ends, the Service will be discontinued unless you renew your subscription with a valid credit card or through any other means of electronic payment, acceptable to us, and provide us with appropriate authorization to charge the credit card or use such other acceptable means of electronic payment.  In the event that you are enrolled in a Paid Plan with an automatic renewal feature, you authorize us to use your credit card to automatically charge recurring fees due for renewal of or continued subscription to a Paid Plan.  All recurring payments will be due in the amounts and frequency specified for the particular Paid Plan.  Your payment method on file will be automatically charged within 24 hours of the end date and time of your current plan, where the end date and time are determined by the initial billing date and time of the plan purchase plus the length of the paid plan (such as 30 days for monthly plans or 365 days for annual plans).  If your billing cycle falls on a weekend or holiday, we may charge you on the next business day.  To cancel the Paid Plan service and stop automatic renewal or recurring payments under a Paid Plan, please see below for Service Cancellation.

d. Other Charges
You may be responsible for paying directly to third parties all charges for products or services furnished by them directly to you that are not expressly covered by your Service Plan.

e. Taxes Fees and Surcharges; Other Charges
Service Rates do not include certain taxes and surcharges that may apply to your Service.  To the extent applicable, as determined by us in our sole discretion, in addition to Service Rates, we may charge state and local sales taxes, surcharges for federal and state Universal Service Fund contributions, and state and local 911 or other emergency service fees.  Charges may also include a cost recovery surcharge.  Surcharges are typically assessed to help defray our costs (or the costs of our Wireless Service Providers (as defined below)) incurred in complying with federal and state telecommunications regulations.  Surcharges are not taxes or fees that the government requires from consumers.  In addition to all applicable Service Rates, you agree to pay all taxes and surcharges charged to you by us, which will be added to your bill.

You are responsible for paying directly to third parties all charges for products or services furnished by them directly to you that are not expressly covered by your Service Plan.  Any fees, fines, or other charges levied by law enforcement agencies or authorities and/or public safety access services due to a false alarm or similar occurrence and related costs will be your responsibility.  We may bill you such charges and costs directly to you, and you agree to pay such charges and costs upon receipt.

f. Payment Methods and Your Payment Responsibilities
You are responsible for paying all amounts due on time and in full.  All charges (including all Service Rates, taxes, and surcharges) will be charged in advance of the term to which they apply and are non-refundable.  If your payment information has changed at the time payment is due, you must arrange for payment or provide us with updated payment information, or else we may discontinue the Service Plan (and the related portion of the Service).  We may terminate or suspend your Service Plan (and the related portion of the Service) without notice to you if your credit, charge, or debit card provider refuses a charge from us or if such card has otherwise expired.  Even if we terminate or suspend your Service Plan (and the related portion of the Service), you will still be responsible for any charges due at the time of such suspension or termination.

You expressly consent and authorize us to:  (1) verify, either ourselves or through third parties, your credit, charge, or debit card information; (2) receive updated account information from the financial institution issuing your credit, charge, or debit card; (3) review your credit history and obtain credit reports to determine your creditworthiness; (4) charge all amounts for which you are responsible to the credit, charge, or debit card account number you have provided.  We will only use this information in connection with determining whether to provide you with or charge you for the Service Plan (and the related portion of the Service) and as permitted by the AoA Privacy Statement.

We may utilize an affiliate or a third-party service provider to process payments for the products and services offered through Audi connect.  Your payment details may be retained by such affiliate or third-party provider if such retention is required by them or otherwise required by law.  AoA does not maintain any information regarding your payment methods.

g. Disputed Charges

If you think that there has been an error in any charge billed by or through us, you must notify us by calling (877) 505-AUDI within sixty (60) days, or such longer period as required by law, after the charge is posted to your account to request an adjustment.  If you do not contact us about the disputed charge within this time period, you agree that you have waived your right to dispute the charge and must pay all amounts due in full.

h. Paid Plan Service Cancellation and Refunds 
You can cancel or terminate your Paid Plan at any time by calling an Audi connect customer service representative at 1-877-505-AUDI or visiting your account profile on the myAudi mobile app, myAudi Marketplace, and/or the myAudi Web Portal following the instructions to cancel a Paid Plan.  If you cancel or terminate your Paid Plan, you will not be entitled to a refund; however, you can continue to use the Service for the remainder of the period for which you paid.  If you are participating in a Paid Plan, you must provide your notice of cancellation at least 15 days prior to the start of your next renewal period in order to avoid being charged for the next renewal period.  You cannot cancel or terminate Connect CARE services.  For more details on Connect CARE services, please refer to Terms of Service for Audi connect services. 

When you cancel a Paid Plan, your cancellation will be effective as of the date you request your Paid Plan to be cancelled.  For the portion of the Service provided by third-party Service Providers pursuant to their separate terms and conditions, you must follow the cancellation terms and requirements specified in those terms and conditions.  Visit the Audi connect Website or the myAudi App for more information, including certain available links to the terms and conditions of Content Providers or Optional Third Parties.



6. myAudi marketplace
a.             Description
As part of the Service, AoA operates an online marketplace (“myAudi Marketplace”) where owners or lessees of certain Vehicles can acquire various digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings from AoA (including certain Paid Plans) or certain Service Partners, including some that can customize your Audi Vehicle with digital designs, ambient interior lighting, and/or sounds (“Audi Themes”).  The myAudi Marketplace is accessible (i) through the myAudi app (“App”) for supported devices and software (i.e., running compatible versions of the Android and iOS (or other designated) operating systems) and (ii) on the Website.  If any provision of this Section conflicts with any other AoA terms, the provisions of this Section will prevail with respect to the myAudi Marketplace.

b.             Technical Requirements:  myAudi Account, Connect Equipment, License, and PSP

To use the myAudi Marketplace and acquire or obtain certain product or service offerings for your Vehicle (such as Audi Themes), you must:  (a) create a myAudi account (see above); (b) have a compatible vehicle with the applicable Equipment; (c) have adequate Internet service to access and connect to the App or Website; and (d) abide by such other requirements as AoA may designate through the myAudi Marketplace (or otherwise) from time to time.  Please note that you may not be able to transfer certain of your digital products (such as an Audi Theme(s)) from your Vehicle to another Vehicle, regardless of whether you own such other Vehicle.  If your Vehicle is later sold or otherwise transferred to a third party, digital products (such as a Theme(s)) purchased for your Vehicle will remain available in such transferred vehicle and may be accessed by the third party unless deleted. 

c.              Audi Themes

Certain Audi Themes can be supported by coordinated lighting effects from the ambient lighting installed in your Vehicle if the vehicle has the appropriate Equipment.  The purchase of the Equipment required for the ambient lighting is not a part of the sale of Audi Themes.  Please consult your local dealership for more information about the capabilities of your Vehicle and its available Equipment for utilizing Audi Theme functionality.

All Audi Themes acquired for your Vehicle will be available for display by the Vehicle owner, lessee, or driver.  Only one Audi Theme can be displayed at a time, but previously acquired Audi Themes remain available for download.  You can also delete Audi Themes, including deletion by a reset of your Vehicle to its default factory setting(s), from the Equipment storage for your Vehicle.  The deleted Audi Themes can be re-uploaded into your Vehicle from your myAudi account from the myAudi App.  In the case that you wish to permanently delete an Audi Theme (including those saved online), you can contact Audi customer service.

d.             Third-Party myAudi Marketplace Service Partners

In addition to certain Paid Plan offerings, AoA operates and maintains the myAudi Marketplace and provides the opportunity for certain Service Partners to sell or license their various digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings to you for use in or in connection with your Vehicle.  These Service Partners submit their offerings along with their associated pricing, terms, and conditions for distribution through the myAudi Marketplace.  Service Partners are responsible for submission of their offering(s) and for their own terms and conditions and the pricing information for their respective offering(s).  This responsibility includes any modification(s) to or the removal of an offering(s) from the myAudi Marketplace.  Unless otherwise indicated, AoA (or any Audi Company) is not responsible for and does not endorse any digital, tangible, and customer product or service offering(s) made available through the myAudi Marketplace.  Further, AoA (or any Audi Company) is not an agent or representative of any Service Partner offering digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings through the myAudi Marketplace. 

Nevertheless, if any displayed digital, tangible, or customer product or service offerings breach the myAudi Marketplace guidelines applicable to Service Partners (e.g., bans on content that is pornographic, glorifies violence, is offensive or racist, or violates the intellectual property rights of a third party) or applicable laws, AoA reserves the right to remove, in its sole discretion, any such digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings from the myAudi Marketplace. 

e.              Access to the myAudi Marketplace and Display

AoA will use reasonable efforts to operate and maintain the myAudi Marketplace.  The digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings displayed on the myAudi Marketplace may be adjustable based on identified user preferences, placement(s) by Service Partners, and user-performed searches (e.g., keyword, genre, price, etc.). 

f.               myAudi Marketplace Purchasing

Digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings can be purchased or licensed directly through the myAudi Marketplace.  Acquiring a Paid Plan is subject to the terms and conditions set forth above, and available product and service offerings from the myAudi Marketplace may have specified run times, including but not limited to on a monthly, annual, or lifetime basis.  When you purchase or license another digital, tangible, and customer product or service offering on/using the myAudi Marketplace, you may be required to agree to separate terms and conditions with the applicable Service Partner.  These separate terms and conditions will be between you and the applicable Service Partner and shall apply in addition to these Terms of Service with AoA.  Additional AoA terms or notices may apply to order submission, payment, and receipt of a digital, tangible, and customer product or service offering as specified through the myAudi Marketplace.  Unless otherwise specified through the myAudi Marketplace, order submission will be through the myAudi Marketplace, and agreement to any additional terms and your right to use digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings will be accepted upon order completion as confirmed by an electronic or other communication from AoA. 

Once your order has been confirmed and your payment received, you can enable (or confirm delivery of) your acquired digital, tangible, and customer product or service offering either directly from your Vehicle or through your myAudi account (provided that a sufficient internet connection exists). 

g.              myAudi Marketplace Pricing

Pricing and availability of all digital, tangible, and customer product or service offerings displayed through the myAudi Marketplace are subject to change at any time prior to your purchase.  

h.             myAudi Marketplace Sales

Unless otherwise expressly stated by AoA or the Content Provider’s applicable terms, all sales are final, and no returns, replacements, or refunds are permitted.  If a replacement, return, or refund is granted for any transaction, the transaction may be reversed, and you may no longer be able to access the digital, tangible, or customer product or service offering that you acquired through that transaction.

i.               myAudi Marketplace Payment Terms

                 i.               Paid Service Plan Payment Terms.

Acquiring a Paid Plan is subject to the payment terms and conditions set forth above.

                 ii.              Payment Terms for Other myAudi Marketplace Products and Services.

For available products or services (e.g., Audi Themes) that may be acquired from the myAudi Marketplace (whether from AoA or a third party), the myAudi Marketplace shall set forth terms for payment.  You may be requested or required to provide payment card or other financial account information to be stored in your myAudi account.  Such purchases may include, without limitation, one-time or recurring purchases from the myAudi website, myAudi Marketplace, or myAudi mobile app and electric vehicle charging from Audi on Electrify America’s or another provider’s charging network, where available.  When you provide a payment method for your myAudi account, you allow and authorize AoA to store, maintain, and recover funds from your specified payment method in accordance with these Payment Terms.  Your payment method may be used by AoA to pay for any fees, charges, surcharges, or applicable taxes for your purchase from AoA or your use of an AoA product or service.  You are also responsible for any access or data fees incurred from third parties (such as your Internet provider or mobile service operator) in connection with your use and viewing of Audi Themes on or through the myAudi Marketplace. 

Your failure to maintain at least one valid payment method in your myAudi account may disrupt your ability to make purchases or access certain paid services that we offer.  For accounts with more than one payment method, you must designate one as your “Preferred Payment Method.”  If the Preferred Payment Method is invalid, expired, or otherwise cannot be charged, you consent and authorize us to charge any alternative payment method(s) in your myAudi account.  You agree that if we are unable to collect payment on any purchase or a good or service, we may reserve the right to discontinue or terminate service without advanced notice.

The payment and invoicing may be managed and processed by a third-party payment service provider (“PSP”).  The PSP, working with AoA, may require acceptance of additional terms or direct registration with the PSP.  However, you can manage your payment information (e.g., billing address) through the myAudi Marketplace (e.g., during the payment process) and your myAudi account.  While AoA may add or remove payment processing methods in its sole discretion, you are solely responsible for the transactions you initiate, any orders you place through the myAudi Marketplace, and the amounts payable.

We may receive updated credit card information (new credit card number or updated expiration date) from your credit card issuer.  The disbursement of the updated credit card information is provided to us at the election of your credit card issuer.  We are not responsible for the distribution of your updated credit card information.  Your credit card issuer may give you the right to opt out of the update service.  It is your responsibility to contact your credit card issuer with regards to your right to opt out of the update service.



7. Termination, Suspension, Reactivation, Change, and Transfer of Service
a. Our Rights to Suspend or Terminate the Service

We can decide to either suspend or terminate the Service without warning, or issue a warning, at any time for any reason in our discretion, including for network or system maintenance, improvement, congestion, or failure; for Equipment failure or malfunction; or if we suspect your Service (in whole or in part) is being used for any unauthorized or inappropriate purpose, as a result of your breach of these Terms of Service or for reasons unrelated to you or your account with us. If suspension or termination of the Service occurs for any reason, you acknowledge and agree that you may not be able to access the Service, including the emergency services. If we elect to terminate your Services (in whole or in part) as a result of your breach of these Terms of Service or unauthorized use of the Services or Equipment or any other reason, you will not be entitled to any refunds or credits. In addition, if we are advised by your financing company or any Audi Company that you no longer own or lease your vehicle, we may terminate your Service.

Availability of the Service is subject to certain technologies remaining commercially available for the Service period (including technologies provided by Wireless Service Providers), and such availability is not guaranteed or subject to any warranty coverage. Please consult your vehicle’s warranty documentation for more information on warranty coverages and important limitations and exclusions.

b. Your Right to Cancel the Service/Credits

Subject to the process for cancellation of a Paid Plan (as set for the above), you may generally cancel the Service at any time by deleting your myAudi account.

c. Reactivation of Service

If you voluntarily delete your myAudi account, you can create another myAudi account at any time. However, if your myAudi account was terminated or suspended by us, you do not have any right to have your Service reactivated even if you cure any of the issues that resulted in the termination or suspension of your Service. It is solely our decision as to whether to allow you to have Service again.

d. Transfer of Service, Sale of Vehicle, and Termination of Lease

If you sell your Vehicle or terminate your lease, you should delete the vehicle from your myAudi account.

We may communicate with you about the Service by providing you with messages through the Equipment in your Vehicle. If you fail to notify us of a sale or transfer of your Vehicle or termination of your lease, we may continue to send messages to the Equipment in your Vehicle. We are not responsible for any privacy related damages that you may suffer as a result of such a failure to notify us of a sale or transfer of your Vehicle.


8. Authority to Use, Terminate, Change, or Transfer Your Service
We will only accept requests from you (or from someone we believe is you or someone with your authorization, such as your authorized agent) to use, activate, cancel, change, reactivate, or transfer the Service.  You agree that we can assume that anyone who provides your registration information is authorized to act on your behalf and that we shall have no responsibility or liability for anything that may arise from our providing of any services to, or acting upon instructions from, any such individual, even if such individual is not, in fact, authorized by you to use the Service or your account.  You should notify us immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your Service or account using the contact information in Section 17 of these Terms of Service.



9. Your Responsibilities
a.             Your Responsibility for the Proper Operation of Your Vehicle and Proper Use of the Service

YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT THE USE OF OR ANY RELIANCE UPON ANY INFORMATION OR CONTENT AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SERVICE IS SOLELY AND COMPLETELY AT YOUR OWN RISK AND RESPONSIBILITY.

b.             Your Responsibility for Insuring Your Vehicle

The Service is provided to you as a convenience.  The Service does not constitute insurance, and you should not rely on it to limit the potential for loss, theft, or damage to your Vehicle or property.  You are solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining any and all insurance for your Vehicle, your passengers, and your property.  No insurance company or insurer will be entitled to any right of subrogation against us or our Service Partners.


c.              Your Responsibility for Maintaining Your Vehicle

In order for us to provide the Service, the Equipment in your Vehicle must be in good working order and your Vehicle must have a working electrical system and adequate battery power.  The Service may not work if you try to modify the Equipment or add any equipment or software in or to your Vehicle that is not expressly authorized by us or is not compatible with the Equipment or Service.  You may need to adjust your use of other Vehicle features, such as adjusting the volume of your radio to hear the audio portions of the Service.  You are solely responsible for the proper maintenance of your Vehicle and its systems (including the Equipment) and for keeping them in good working order and in compliance with these Terms of Service and all applicable laws.

d.             No Illegal, Fraudulent, or Abusive Use of the Service

You may not use the Equipment, Service, or myAudi website in any way that is illegal, fraudulent, or abusive, including to harass, threaten, abuse, defame, or slander any individual or entity.  You may use our emergency services, including Connect CARE, only for actual emergencies and legitimate vehicle assistance needs.  You may not use the Service in a manner that interferes with any other customer’s use of our Service or our provision of our Service to our other customers.

Certain information you receive through the Service belongs to us or our Service Partners (or other third parties) and may be subject to one or more copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, or other legal protections.  You may not (and may not permit or cause any other party to) sell or resell or otherwise use the Service or any information provided through the Service for commercial purposes nor may you reproduce, copy, modify, attempt to reverse engineer, or make derivative works from the Service.  In addition, you may not display or distribute information or content provided through the Service except as expressly permitted by these Terms and Conditions.

f.               No Rights to Telephone Numbers or Other Addresses


You have no property right in any number, address, or other communication identifier that may be assigned to you or to the Equipment in connection with the Service.  Any such number, address, or identifier may be changed from time to time.

g.              Your Responsibility for Others Who Use Your Vehicle

You are solely responsible for those who use the Service in your Vehicle or use your authentication information, even if you later claim that the use was not authorized, and you will be responsible and promptly pay for any charges arising from such use and any damages to or expenses incurred by us or any of our Service Partners as a result of such use.  Neither we nor any Service Partner has any obligation to inquire about the authority of anyone using your Vehicle or other information that can be used to identify your account to request the Service for your Vehicle.  You are responsible for the security of any passwords that you use to access the Service.  We will make any changes to your account or charge you for any amounts authorized by a person who provides your authentication information.

Please see the Audi connect Terms of Service to understand specific connect services and features, such as locating a lost or stolen Vehicle, emergency assistance and service, and content providers.

These parties are collectively referred to in these Terms of Service as our “Service Partner(s)” and may include providers of the wireless networks on which the Service relies (“Wireless Service Providers”), emergency response service providers (“Response Provider(s)”), payment processors, and content providers (“Content Providers”).  In some cases, one or more of the Audi Companies may be a Service Partner.  In the event that any of our Service Partners impose additional terms and conditions on the services they provide, by accessing such services, you agree to comply with any additional terms and conditions imposed by them, which will be available on the myAudi website or the myAudi app.


b.             Points of Interest

The Service may use various, connected third-party services and Content Providers to make it easier to search for numerous points of interest, e.g., charging stations, fuel prices, parking information, weather, travel information, train information, flight information, restaurant search, hotel search, and other available information through the browsing capabilities of the Vehicle’s systems or Equipment (“POIs”).  In connection with this search feature, your Vehicle’s systems or Equipment may send various data or categories of data to us or our Service Partners.  You may also receive an “offer icon” next to certain POIs that you search for indicating that special offers and promotions are available.  This portion of the Service uses de-identified data.  You may deactivate (or reactivate) this feature using the available “privacy” mode(s) for your Vehicle or its applicable Equipment.  Please review your Vehicle manual for more information.  See also below for more information about our privacy practices.

c.              Software

We use software in connection with the Service.  We (or our Service Partners) own or have rights to all such software, and you do not acquire any rights in such software other than the right to use such software as reasonably necessary for you to use the Service as may be further specified and permitted as part of the Service Plan.  We (or our Service Partners) may update or modify the software contained in your Vehicle’s systems or the Equipment from time to time, and we may do this remotely without notifying you or seeking your consent.  These software updates and modifications may affect or erase data that you have previously stored on the Equipment in your Vehicle (such as specific route or destination information).  We are not responsible for any lost or erased (or otherwise affected) data, information, or content, and you are solely responsible for the data, information, and content that you may have downloaded, uploaded, transmitted, or otherwise stored from, to, on, or through the Equipment or Service.

d.             Voice Recognition

Voice recognition software, which may be able to recognize different voices, accents, speech patterns, and words, can be used in connection with certain aspects of the Service.  We do not represent or guarantee that such software will recognize or work with your or other voices, accents, or speech patterns or recognize some or all words some or all of the time.  In addition, activating privacy mode in vehicles equipped with this feature will turn off some or all voice recognition features in these vehicles.

e.              Events Beyond Our Control

Various conditions beyond our control may prevent or delay us from providing Service to you or affect or limit the quality of the Service.  Some examples are atmospheric, geographic, or topographic conditions (such as tall buildings, hills, or tunnels); damage to or failure to maintain your Vehicle or the Equipment in good working order; government laws, rules, or regulations; failure, congestion, or outages of utility or wireless networks (including interruption of cellular service or interference from multiple connected mobile devices); war; an act of God; natural disasters; inclement weather; and labor strikes.  In the event of any of the foregoing, we may, in our discretion, suspend or terminate the Service (in whole or in part) or terminate your Service Plan without notice to you and without any liability.  We are not responsible for delay or failure in providing Service due to conditions beyond our control, and you are not entitled to credit or a refund as a result of any such delay or failure.

In the event of any regulatory, governmental, or other legally compelled changes or discontinuation or change of necessary telecommunications systems and services (e.g., if our Wireless Service Provider terminates or restricts wireless services of the type used by your Vehicle’s Equipment), we are not responsible for designing, developing, or making available any replacement Equipment to allow you to continue to receive the Service.  However, if we or any third party does make replacement Equipment available, you are solely responsible for replacing, as well as the cost of replacing, any Equipment that is necessitated as a result of such change or discontinuation.

f.               Push and Mobile Device Notifications

The Service may offer push notification or other mobile communication capabilities. In particular, when you install the myAudi mobile application, you agree to receive notifications, including push notifications, from us on your device. We may contact you by push notification to send you additional information about myAudi, the Service, your Vehicle, marketing communications, or other services and information. You acknowledge and consent to receiving messages or push notifications from myAudi and even when you are not actively using the myAudi mobile application. You may choose whether or not to continue receiving push notifications by adjusting your device’s settings.

We advise against using any hand-held device, including viewing of any mobile device push notifications, while driving or otherwise operating your Vehicle or any vehicle.



12. Collection and Use of Your Vehicle and Subscriber Data
Your Vehicle may send various data or categories of data to AoA, and the Service may connect with data from various third-party services, and in particular to search for or with respect to describing numerous POIs or enabling the display of advertisements regarding POIs or other products or services in proximity to your current position or destination (and for other purposes).
