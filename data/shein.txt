**Please note single-day purchase limitations:** Customers in the United States cannot currently place order(s) that exceed $800 on a single day.

**5.2 Colors.** We make reasonable efforts to display, as accurately as possible, the colors of our products that appear on the Services. However, because the actual colors you see will depend on your monitor, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display of any color will be an accurate depiction of the color of the color of the product you selected to purchase.

**5.3 Shipping.** Although some of the products sold on the Services may be available to be shipped from a location within the United States, other products may be shipped from outside of the United States. We may include a “Quickship” tag on the product page of certain products. A “Quickship” tag will let you know that the item may be available to be shipped from a location in the United States. However, if such item is no longer available to be shipped from within the United States by the time your order is placed, it will be shipped from outside the United States.

**5.4 Title and Shipment.** Title to any purchased items fulfilled outside the United States transfers from the respective seller (i.e., SHEIN Distribution Corporation if you purchase a product sold by SHEIN or the Third-Party Seller if you purchase a product sold by a Third-Party Seller) to you as the respective customer once the items are over international water (i.e., not within the jurisdiction of any country). Title to any purchased items fulfilled in the United States transfers from the respective seller (i.e., SHEIN Distribution Corporation if purchase a product sold by SHEIN or the Third-Party Seller if you purchase a product sold by a Third-Party Seller) to you when the products are delivered to the shipping address provided by you. SHEIN neither owns nor takes title to any product sold by a Third-Party Seller. Any legitimate claims arising from loss or damage during delivery of the order by the carrier to your delivery address must be made to Customer Service within fourteen (14) days after your received the goods or should have received the goods (in case of lost goods). If we determine that your claim is valid, at our discretion, we will either replace the item that was damaged or lost during shipment (subject to availability and using the same shipping method without additional shipping costs, and subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth herein), or we will reimburse you the purchase price and shipping cost paid (provided that the shipping cost did not include other items that were delivered without damage).

Based on your request, we will either exchange the product or refund you the purchase price (free return shipping will only be available for one return per order).

If you choose a Wallet credit, you will not be able to redeem the Wallet credit for cash, except as required under applicable law. Certain items are non-returnable as specified in the Return Policy .

**5.5 Purchases from Third-Party Sellers.** Because SHEIN does not own any of the products that are listed by Third-Party Sellers, all such products are purchased from and sold directly by such Third-Party Sellers. SHEIN is not a party to any transaction for products listed by Third-Party Sellers, and accordingly, any contract for the purchase of products listed by Third-Party Sellers through the Services is entered into directly between the applicable purchaser and such Third-Party Seller. While SHEIN may facilitate these transactions through the Services (including by acting as limited payments agent on behalf of Third-Party Sellers to process payments on such sellers’ behalf), we have no control over and do not guarantee the existence, quality, timing, condition, safety or legality of products offered for sale by Third-Party Sellers through the Services; the truth or accuracy of listings for products sold by Third-Party Sellers; the integrity, responsibility, or any actions of any Third-Party Sellers; the ability of any Third-Party Sellers to sell products; or that any Third-Party Seller will actually complete a transaction. SHEIN is not an auctioneer, seller, or carrier of any items that are listed for sale by Third-Party Sellers.

**5.6 Release for Disputes with Third-Party Sellers.** To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, SHEIN expressly disclaims any and all liability that may arise between you and any Third-Party Seller. The Services merely provide a venue for connecting our users with Third-Party Sellers. Because SHEIN is not a party to the actual contracts between you and any Third-Party Seller that you purchase a product from, in the event that you have a dispute with any Third-Party Seller, you release SHEIN, its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, and all of their officers, employees, investors, agents, partners and licensors, but excluding any Third-Party Sellers (each a **“SHEIN Party”** and collectively, the **“SHEIN Parties”** ) from any and all claims, demands, or damages (actual or consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes.

If you are a California resident, you hereby waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which states, “A general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.” The foregoing release does not apply to any claims, demands, or any losses, damages, rights and actions of any kind, including personal injuries, death or property damage for any unconscionable commercial practice by a party or for such party’s fraud, deception, false, promise, misrepresentation or concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact in connection with the Services

12\. DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY SINCE IT LIMITS THE LIABILITY OF SHEIN TO YOU.**

13\. LEGAL DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT FOR USERS IN THE UNITED STATES

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING CLAUSES CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT**

**13.1 Applicability of Arbitration Agreement.** Subject to the terms of this Arbitration Agreement, you and SHEIN agree that any dispute, claim, disagreement arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Site, App, Services or the Agreement and prior versions of the Agreement, including claims and disputes that arose between us before the effective date of this Agreement (each a **“Dispute”** ), will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (i) you and SHEIN may assert claims or seek relief in a small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and (ii) you and SHEIN may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents).

**13.2 Waiver of Jury Trial.** YOU AND SHEIN HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and SHEIN are instead electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement, except as specified in the paragraph entitled “Applicability of Arbitration Agreement” above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is subject to very limited review. Discovery may be limited in arbitration, and procedures are more streamlined than in court.

**13.3 Class Action Waiver.** YOU AND SHEIN AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED “BATCH ARBITRATION” BELOW, EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, REPRESENTATIVE, OR MASS ACTION BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF IS AVAILABLE, AND DISPUTES OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. Subject to this Arbitration Agreement, the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the party’s individual claim. To the extent permissible by law, there shall be no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated as a representative action or as a private attorney general action, including but not limited to claims brought pursuant to the Private Attorney General Act of 2004, Cal. Lab. Code § 2698, et seq. This means that you may not seek relief on behalf of any other parties in arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Arbitration Agreement, if a court decides by means of a final decision, not subject to any further appeal or recourse, that the limitations of this paragraph, “Class Action Waiver” are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request for public injunctive relief), you and SHEIN agree that that particular claim or request for relief (and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and shall be pursued in the courts indicated in paragraph 13.11 below. All other Disputes shall be arbitrated or litigated in small claims court. This paragraph does not prevent you or SHEIN from participating in a class-wide settlement of claims.

**13.4 Informal Dispute Resolution.** You and SHEIN agree to try to resolve any Dispute informally before resorting to arbitration. You and SHEIN therefore agree that before either party commences arbitration against the other (or initiates an action in small claims court if a party so elects), we will personally meet and confer telephonically or via videoconference, in a good faith effort to resolve informally any Dispute covered by this Arbitration Agreement ( **“Informal Dispute Resolution Conference”** ). If you are represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference, but you will also participate in the conference. The party initiating a Dispute must give notice to the other party in writing of its intent to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference ( **“Notice”** ), which shall occur within 45 days after the other party receives such Notice, unless an extension is mutually agreed upon by the parties. Notice to SHEIN that you intend to initiate an Informal Dispute Resolution Conference should be sent by email to [us\_legal@sheingroup.com](mailto:us_legal@sheingroup.com) or regular mail to Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934. Notice to you will be sent to the address or email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The Notice must include: (1) your name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address associated with your account (if you have one); (2) the name, telephone number, mailing address and e‐mail address of your counsel, if any; and (3) a description of your Dispute. The Informal Dispute Resolution Conference shall be individualized such that a separate conference must be held each time either party initiates a Dispute, even if the same law firm or group of law firms represents multiple users in similar cases, unless all parties agree; multiple individuals initiating a Dispute cannot participate in the same Informal Dispute Resolution Conference unless all parties agree. Engaging in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference is a condition precedent and requirement that must be fulfilled before commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the Informal Dispute Resolution Conference process required by this section.

**13.5 Arbitration Procedures.** You and SHEIN agree that this Arbitration Agreement affects interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq., applies. If the Informal Dispute Resolution Process described above does not resolve satisfactorily within sixty (60) days after receipt of your Notice, you and SHEIN agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS. Disputes involving claims, counterclaims, or requests for relief under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest, shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other Disputes shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. Any arbitration of a Dispute relating to your access to or use of the Site, the App, or Services, any products sold or distributed through the Site or the App primarily for personal, family or household purposes shall also be subject to the allocation of arbitration costs and other requirements of the JAMS’ policy regarding Consumer Arbitrations Pursuant to Pre-Dispute Clauses Minimum Standards of Procedural Fairness available at https://www.jamsadr.com/consumer-minimum-standards/. JAMS’s rules are also available at www.jamsadr.com or by calling JAMS at 800-352-5267. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will select an alternative arbitral forum. Your responsibility to pay any JAMS fees and costs will be solely as set forth in the applicable JAMS Arbitration Rules. If there is a conflict between the JAMS rules and this Arbitration Agreement, this Arbitration Agreement shall control.

**13.6** A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a request for arbitration (the **“Request”** ). The Request must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing address, e‐mail address of the party seeking arbitration and the account username (if applicable) as well as the email address associated with any applicable account; (2) a statement of the legal claims being asserted and the factual bases of those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and an accurate, good‐faith calculation of the amount in controversy in United States Dollars; (4) a statement certifying completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) evidence that the requesting party has paid any necessary filing fees in connection with such arbitration. To initiate arbitration, you must send the Request to Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934. If we initiate arbitration, we will send the Request to the address or email address associated with your account or to your publicly available address or email address if you do not have an account with us. The parties shall bear their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Request was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Unless you and SHEIN otherwise agree, or the Batch Arbitration process discussed below is triggered, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside.

**13.7 Batch Arbitration.** To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and SHEIN agree that in the event that there are twenty five (25) or more individual Requests of a substantially similar nature filed against SHEIN by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law firms, or organizations, within a thirty (30) day period (or as soon as possible thereafter), JAMS shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of 100 Requests per batch (plus, to the extent there are less than 100 Requests left over after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Requests); (2) appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch as a single consolidated arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees due per side per batch, one procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be determined by the arbitrator, and one final award ( **“Batch Arbitration”** ). All parties agree that Requests are of a “substantially similar nature” if they arise out of or relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issues and seek the same or similar relief. To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise JAMS, and JAMS shall appoint a sole standing arbitrator to determine the applicability of the Batch Arbitration process ( **“Administrative Arbitrator”** ). In an effort to expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitrator’s fees shall be paid by SHEIN. You and SHEIN agree to cooperate in good faith with JAMS to implement the Batch Arbitration process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of Requests, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the arbitration proceedings.

**13.8 Authority of Arbitrator.** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including, without limitation, disputes arising out of or related to the interpretation or application of the Arbitration Agreement, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or any portion of the Arbitration Agreement, except for the following: (1) all Disputes arising out of or relating to the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver,” including any claim that that same paragraph is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that it has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (2) except as expressly contemplated in the paragraph entitled “Batch Arbitration,” all Disputes about the payment of arbitration fees shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; (3) all Disputes about whether either party has satisfied any condition precedent to arbitration shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator; and (4) all Disputes about which version of the Arbitration Agreement applies shall be decided only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant motions dispositive of all or part of any Dispute. The arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction

**13.9 30-Day Right to Opt Out.** You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to us\_legal@sheingroup.com within thirty (30) days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement. Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your account (if you have one), and an unequivocal statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you opt out of this Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may currently have, or may enter in the future, with us. If the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the courts indicated in paragraph 13.11 below.

**13.10 Invalidity, Expiration.** Except as provided in the paragraph entitled “Class Action Waiver”, if any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Arbitration Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. You further agree that any Dispute that you have with SHEIN as detailed in this Arbitration Agreement must be initiated via arbitration within the applicable statute of limitation for that claim or controversy, or it will be forever time barred. Likewise, you agree that all applicable statutes of limitation will apply to such arbitration in the same manner as those statutes of limitation would apply in the applicable court of competent jurisdiction.

**13.11 Modification.** Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms to the contrary, we agree that if SHEIN makes any future material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will notify you. Unless you reject the change within thirty (30) days of such change become effective by writing to SHEIN at Paracorp, 2140 S. DuPont Hwy Camden, DE 19934, your continued use of the Site, the App and/or Services, including the acceptance of products and services offered on the Site or App following the posting of changes to this Arbitration Agreement constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. Changes to this Arbitration Agreement do not provide you with a new opportunity to opt out of the Arbitration Agreement if you have previously agreed to a version of these Terms and did not validly opt out of arbitration. If you reject any change or update to this Arbitration Agreement, and you were bound by an existing agreement to arbitrate Disputes arising out of or relating in any way to your access to or use of the Services or of the Site or the App, or these Terms, the provisions of this Arbitration Agreement as of the date you first accepted the Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to these Terms) remain in full force and effect. SHEIN will continue to honor any valid opt outs of the Arbitration Agreement that you made to a prior version of these Terms.

**13.12 Governing Courts.** To the extent that the Dispute is not covered by any arbitration agreement between you and us, it shall proceed before the state or federal courts located in Delaware (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside).

14\. LEGAL TERMS

No waiver of any term of the Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. Our failure to assert any right or provision under the Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defense of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you. In that event, you will have no further obligation to defend us in that matter.

**14.10 Severability.** If any portion of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion must be construed in a manner to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intention of the parties, and the remaining portions must remain in full force and effect.

**14.11 Export Control.** You may not use, export, import, or transfer the Services except as authorized by U.S. law, the laws of the jurisdiction in which you obtained the Service, and any other applicable laws.

● Extra 5% OFF
SHEIN CLUB Membership offers you an exclusive 5% discount (“Extra 5% OFF”) applicable to non-sale items on the Site and the App (certain exclusions may apply). This Extra 5% OFF may be used in conjunction with coupons that may be available to you. The products with the Extra 5% OFF will bear an exclusive discounted price logo. The Extra 5% OFF applies to select items that are currently in stock, and excludes flash sale products and other targeted discounts.

● SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons
After becoming a member of SHEIN CLUB, you will receive SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons (“SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon(s)” or “Shipping Coupon(s)”) periodically as specified below. The SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons can be used towards specified shipping costs on orders of physical products you place on SHEIN.
There are two types of SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons: the first type can be redeemed for free specified shipping, and the second type can be redeemed for a discount on specified shipping costs, associated with an order of physical products on SHEIN. For the first type, only one SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon may be used on an order. For the second type, multiple Shipping Coupons can be used on an order to reduce the shipping fee. SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons must be used at the same time that an order is placed and cannot be redeemed towards shipping costs of a previous order. The SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons can be used along with other promotional coupons or discounts. However, the SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons may not be used along other “free shipping” coupons. When the actual amount to be paid for an order does not meet the threshold of the regular free shipping promotion, the system will automatically use the SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon to offset all or part of the specified shipping costs incurred for the order. When the actual amount to be paid for an order meets the threshold of the regular free shipping promotion, the system will use the free shipping promotion and will not apply your SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon to the order. The SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons can only be used towards the purchase of products on SHEIN and cannot be redeemed towards shipping costs of any return items.
The specific applicable conditions of your SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon can be viewed on the SHEIN CLUB Membership benefits page and on the “My Coupons” section (under “My Assets”) of your SHEIN User Account. We will also send you relevant benefits information and usage restrictions by email, APP PUSH, etc. States/Provinces may have different shipping policies. Please refer to Shipping Info for details.
SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupons will be issued to SHEIN CLUB Members every 31 days and will have an expiration date as specified thereon. Please note the expiration date on your SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon and use it before the expiration date. Once a SHEIN CLUB Shipping Coupon has expired, the Coupon cannot be redeemed or otherwise used. Other restrictions can be viewed on "My Coupons" section of “My Assets” in your SHEIN User Account.

If all your outstanding Credit Rewards and Promotional Wallet Credits are eliminated and there is still a balance remaining, we may reduce the value of your returned purchase by $1 per $1 Credit Reward.
