Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes
PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU AND Dunkin' BRANDS AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

 

WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE. You hereby agree that any dispute between you and Dunkin’ Brands and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “Dunkin' Brands”) arising from or relating to (a) your use or misuse of the DD/BR Online Services (including without limitation any Dunkin’ Card or Baskin-Robbins Card), (b) these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof or (c) the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules (available at www.adr.org), in effect on the date thereof. If there is a conflict between AAA Rules and the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate, the rules set forth in this Agreement to Arbitrate will govern. For purposes of this section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).

 

WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can.

 

PRE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advance written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Dunkin' Brands will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Dunkin' Brands and you must provide such notice by e-mail to customerservice@dunkinbrands.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line.  During such 60-day notice period, we agree to endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.

 

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. To initiate arbitration, you or Dunkin' Brands must do the following things:

 

(1)    Write a demand for Arbitration. The demand must include a description of the claim and the amount of damages sought to be recovered. You can find a copy of a Demand for Arbitration at www.adr.org.

(2)    Send three copies of the Demand for Arbitration, plus the appropriate filing fee to: American Arbitration Associate, Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100 Voorhees, NJ 08043.

(3)    Send one copy of the Demand for Arbitration to the other party.

 

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dunkin' Brands will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.  If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dunkin' Brands for all fees associated with the arbitration that Dunkin' Brands paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.

 

AUTHORITY OF ARBITRATOR. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.

NO CLASS ACTIONS. Dunkin' Brands and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Dunkin' Brands nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.

 

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and Dunkin' Brands in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND Dunkin' BRANDS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ADVISED THAT YOU MAY CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY IN DECIDING TO ACCEPT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.

 

OPT-OUT OF AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE. You can decline this agreement to arbitrate by emailing Dunkin' Brands at customerservice@dunkinbrands.com and providing the requested information as follows: (1) Your Name; (2) the URL of the Terms and Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes; (3) Your Address; (4) Your Phone Number; (5) and clear statement that you wish to opt out of this arbitration provision in the Terms.  The Opt-Out Notice must be emailed no later than 30 days after the date you first accept the Terms by using the DD/BR Online Services.

 

If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced. In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, then such dispute between us arising under the Terms or your misuse of the DD/BR Online Services will be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and governed in accordance with the laws of the state of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law rules.

Taxes
You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies or fees (including any sales, use or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with these Terms or the DD/BR Online Services by any authority.

Dunkin’ Rewards members ("Members") receive ten (10) Points for each dollar ($1) spent on Qualifying Products, exclusive of sales tax and any discounts.
Boosted Status: Members who have twelve (12) Qualifying Visits (as defined below) during a calendar month will receive 1.2 times more points (12 points as opposed to 10 points)  for each dollar ($1) spent on Qualifying Product for the remainder of the calendar month and for the next three consecutive calendar months.   Each Calendar month in which a Member has twelve (12) Qualifying Visits will extend on a rolling basis the Boosted Status benefit period.
Bonus points may be offered from time to time based on geographic location or Program activity (e.g. the purchase of certain Qualifying Products during certain time periods or making Qualifying Purchases using Mobile ordering). Bonus Points are provided at the base rate of ten (10) points for each dollar ($1) spent. Points for such activities will be awarded as described in the applicable offer and will be subject to any additional terms set forth with that offer. Dunkin’ is under no obligation to provide Members with any particular number of Point opportunities or special offer.
A Member will record a “Qualifying Visit” by making a Qualifying Purchase at a participating Dunkin’ store location that is at least sixty (60) minutes after the last Qualifying Visit and is at least $0.99 cents after all discounts and before tax. Gift card purchases or reloads, and reward redemption purchases only, do not qualify.
Qualifying Products are all Dunkin’ food and beverage products purchased at participating Dunkin’ locations in the manner provided in these terms.  Qualifying Products exclude the purchase or reload of a Dunkin’ Gift Cards, Reward Coupon Redemptions, purchase of retail merchandise, Keurig Brewers or Newspapers, donations to charity and product purchases on shopdunkin.com and other online platforms.

Point balances will be available in your account on the Website and in the Dunkin’ App. In certain cases, it may take twenty-four (24) hours or more after a Qualifying Purchase for Points to be available.
From time to time, participating Dunkin’ store locations may experience system unavailability and cannot process a Dunkin’ Rewards transaction and Points will not be recorded. Members can contact Customer Care to request that Customer Care manually enter the points for the transaction into the Members account. The Customer Care Team can be contacted by email at customerservice@dunkinbrands.com or at 1-800-447-0013.
For Members who have more than one Dunkin Card enrolled, all points will be accumulated in one main account.
Baskin-Robbins® Gift Cards cannot be entered into the Dunkin’ app or be used as an enrolled Dunkin’ Card.  However, they may be used for payment once a Dunkin’ Rewards ID is scanned.
Delivery Platforms: Points cannot be earned on third party delivery platforms.
How To Redeem Points for Rewards

Points may be redeemed for Rewards, which consist of select Dunkin’ food and beverage items. The number of points required for select food and beverages will be outlined in the reward catalog, which is available in the Dunkin’ app and on dunkindonuts.com ("Website") and may be changed from time to time. Members must have at least enough available Points in their account for the Reward that the Member wishes to redeem. Points accrued by a Member in any purchase or transaction may only be redeemed for Rewards in a separate, subsequent purchase or transaction.
Points can only be exchanged for Rewards in the Dunkin’ App. Points cannot be redeemed for Rewards on the Website.
During Early Access, Rewards will only be redeemable at participating Dunkin’ store locations in California.
To redeem the Points for a Reward in the Dunkin’ App, go to the rewards catalog and select the Reward you wish to activate.  The Reward will be added to your account.
Points will be subtracted from the Member's account immediately when a Reward is requested based on the total Points for the requested Reward. Points will be restored to a Member's account only in the event Dunkin’ determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that the Reward requested by that Member is unavailable or cannot be delivered. Dunkin’ reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards and limit the number of Rewards available.
How to Redeem Rewards

To use the Reward, Members need to scan the Reward at the time of purchase or apply it to an order in the Dunkin’ App.
Each Reward has a unique number and can only be used once. Once a Reward has been applied, it is non-refundable.
The Reward must be used within the time frame specified for that Reward or it may expire. Standard Rewards are valid for 30 days from date of activation of a Reward. Other promotional Rewards may be available from time to time and may have different expiration dates which will be outlined in the Reward.
Points, Rewards and Member benefits may not be gifted, purchased, sold, bartered, brokered or otherwise transferred, except that the Program may allow a Member to donate or gift Points and/or Rewards in certain limited instances.
Attempts to redeem single use offers and verification codes for Rewards multiple times or through multiple users constitutes fraud and may result in the termination or suspension of your account.
Account Inactivity

If a Member does not purchase a Qualifying Product for a period of 6 months, any Points that the member has previously earned will expire and will be removed from the Members’ account.  Points cannot be reinstated after they have been removed.

Dunkin’ also has the right to terminate a Member’s account if the Member does not purchase a Qualifying Product with an enrolled Dunkin’ Card or Loyalty ID for a period of twelve (12) months or longer. 

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY – IT MAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU AND DUNKIN’ AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

WE BOTH AGREE TO ARBITRATE. You hereby agree that any dispute between you and Dunkin’ Brands, Inc. and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “Dunkin'”) arising from or relating to any aspect of the relationship between you and Dunkin’ (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court. You and Dunkin’ each also agrees that the Agreement affects interstate commerce so that the Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law, not state law, apply and govern the enforceability of this dispute resolution provision (despite the general choice of law provision set forth below).

WHAT IS ARBITRATION: Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, but court review of an arbitration award is limited.

PRE-ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. Prior to initiating any arbitration, you must first give us an opportunity to resolve your claim by sending an individual written description that describes in detail the individual damages that you claim to have suffered by e-mail to customerservice@dunkinbrands.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line. We agree to endeavor to settle amicably by mutual, good faith discussions any Covered Disputes. If we are unable to resolve your claim within 60 days despite those mutual discussions, then either you or we may start arbitration or small claims court proceedings. A court, not an arbitrator, will decide whether this condition precedent has been satisfied

ARBITRATION PROCEDURES. To begin arbitration, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your claim to customerservice@dunkinbrands.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line and to the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”). The arbitration of all disputes will be administered by the AAA under its Consumer Arbitration Rules in effect at the time the arbitration is commenced, except to the extent any of those rules conflicts with our agreement in these Terms, in which case these Terms will govern. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org. If the claims asserted in any request or demand for arbitration could have been brought in small claims court, then either you or Dunkin’ may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time before the arbitrator is appointed, by notifying the other party of that election in writing. Upon filing of the arbitration demand, Dunkin’ will pay or reimburse all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any claim asserted in an arbitration demand is deemed to be frivolous, the defending party shall be entitled to recover its attorneys’ fees and any filing, administration, and arbitrator fees incurred.

NO CLASS ACTIONS. Dunkin' and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Dunkin' nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.  If a court or arbitrator determines in an action between you and us that any part of this class action waiver is unenforceable with respect to any claim, the arbitration agreement and class action waiver will not apply to that claim, but they will still apply to any and all other claims that you or we may assert in that or any other action.

WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. If a claim proceeds in court rather than through arbitration, YOU AND DUNKIN’ EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.

In any circumstances where the Agreement to Arbitrate Disputes permits the parties to litigate in court, then such dispute between us arising under the Terms or your misuse of the DD/BR Online Services will be subject to the jurisdiction and venue of the state and federal courts located in Boston, Massachusetts, and governed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, excluding its conflict of law rules.

Miscellaneous

There is no membership fee associated with the Dunkin’ Rewards. “Points” accumulated and Rewards redeemed under Dunkin’ Rewards  have no cash value and are not redeemable for cash. No portion of any payment for purchases qualifying for Dunkin’ Rewards or any Points, Member benefits, or Rewards constitute consideration paid for any of the foregoing. Dunkin’ reserves the right to limit the redemption of specific Rewards and Member benefits and limit the number of Points, Rewards, and Member benefits available.
Members may not sell, transfer or assign Points, and a Member is only eligible to receive Points for Qualifying Purchases or other Point-earning opportunities offered through Dunkin’ Rewards.
Dunkin’ reserves the right to terminate a Member's account and/or participation, including canceling points and Rewards, in the Dunkin’ Rewards if it the Member has violated the Privacy Policy, Online Terms of Use, or these Terms and Conditions, or if the use of the Member's account is unauthorized, fraudulent or otherwise unlawful or in violation of any of those policies or terms. Dunkin’ also reserves the right to cancel Points credited to a Member’s account if it is determined that (a) Points were incorrectly posted to the Member’s account, or (b) Points were obtained fraudulently.
Dunkin’ reserves the right to change, modify or terminate Dunkin’ Rewards, or any or all benefits under the Program or any policy pertaining to the Program, at any time, for any reason, including our right to change the expiration date or redemption value of Points or Rewards, merge the Program with another program, or to adjust how Points or Rewards are received, calculated or redeemed.
Dunkin’ Rewards Program will continue until such time as Dunkin’, in its sole discretion, elects to terminate the Dunkin’ Rewards Program. Dunkin’ has the right to terminate the Dunkin’ Rewards at any time without providing electronic or written notice to you.
Dunkin’ reserves the right to offer additional Dunkin’ Rewards  benefits or bonus Points to some Members based on geographic location, program participation or other criteria as determined by Dunkin’. Some of our special promotional offers, benefits, and communications also may be based on the volume or type of purchases. Special offers are distributed by email or through the Dunkin’ App, so you must opt-in to receive promotional and marketing emails from Dunkin’ Rewards and provide a valid email address in order to receive them via email. You may opt-out of receiving additional Dunkin’ Rewards communications and still remain an active Dunkin’ Program Member.
Dunkin’ and participating Dunkin’ store locations, in their sole discretion, may periodically offer the opportunity for special gifts or prizes. These gifts and prizes may be distributed via the Dunkin’ App, online, or via email from time to time, based on the information the Member has in the Member account. Members must have their Dunkin’ App set to receive notifications and/or have opted-in to receive email communications in order to receive these gifts and prizes.
From time to time, Members may be provided with the opportunity to redeem Points for purchases from third-party providers.
The Program is provided by Dunkin’ Brands, Inc., and all Points and Rewards are issued by and solely the obligation of Dunkin’.
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without regard to conflict of laws provisions or principles.

You may use the DD Online Services solely for the purpose of learning about the Dunkin' franchise system. If you choose to, you may also submit an electronic application seeking consideration as a prospective franchisee via www.dunkinfranchising.com.


19.      Dispute Resolution

YOU AND Dunkin’ AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Any dispute between you and Dunkin’ and its agents, employees, officers, directors, principals, successors, assigns, subsidiaries or affiliates (collectively for purposes of this section, “Dunkin’”) arising from or relating to these Terms and their interpretation or the breach, termination or validity thereof, the relationships which result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, "Covered Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration in Suffolk County, Commonwealth of Massachusetts administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules, in effect on the date thereof. Prior to initiating any arbitration, the initiating party will give the other party at least 60-days' advanced written notice of its intent to file for arbitration. Dunkin’ will provide such notice by e-mail to your e-mail address on file with Dunkin’ and you must provide such notice by e-mail to customerservice@dunkinbrands.com with “Legal Dispute” appearing in the subject line.  During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration.

Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules.  If, however, you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dunkin’ will pay as much of the filing, administration and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive for you.  If the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dunkin’ for all fees associated with the arbitration that Dunkin’ paid on your behalf, which you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA's rules.

The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not, however, have the power to award punitive or exemplary damages, the right to which each party hereby waives, and the arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. Dunkin’ and you agree that any Covered Dispute will be submitted to arbitration on an individual basis only. Neither Dunkin’ nor you are entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis.  If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision will be severed and the remaining arbitration terms will be enforced (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). Regardless of any statute or law to the contrary, notice on any claim arising from or related to these Terms must be made within one (1) year after such claim arose or be forever barred. For purposes of this section, these Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA).


20.    Taxes

You are solely responsible for any and all duties, taxes, levies or fees (including any sales, use or withholding taxes) imposed on or in connection with these Terms or the DD Online Services by any authority.
